I never played match 3 games until recently, and the beginning levels teach you how it works. I like being able to decorate my bakery just the way I want it and everything is so polished. I'm really all about the puzzles, though, and I love the creative boosters, especially when I can combine them to blow up the board. It's epically delightful when you can get more than one gingerbread man at a time and they do their little celebrations! Fun \ud83d\ude0a. Great game..The graphics are very nice, even cute. It runs very smoothly, no lag, freezing or crashing. So far it's not impossibly challenging like most of these types of games. You are given good choices for the decor and everything is bright and colorful. I like this game very much. I recommend giving it a try.. Love love love this game , this actually the first game I've stayed with , normally give up with games like this because they are near on impossible to do ,im on level 402 , no ads to bother you , good levels of difficulty, easy, not so easy , hard , hard levels are doable just need to keep at it , you do get prizes along the way to help , with not having to spend money , well done to the developers, you got this just right \ud83d\ude06. I love this game very well . All the levels are easy . \u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a. You have to add other chapters also, I complete all the chapters now.. I'm absolutely floored. This game is cute, fun, and manages to be both challenging and relaxing. The story, characters, graphics, and customization options are top quality and adorable. Even the ads are manageable. But what I find most incredible, is the developers and their support team really seem to care about their users. I've had my issues, but I can see they're doing their best to fix and improve the game experience. Pat yourselves on the back, because you guys are setting a new standard !. I really enjoy this game. I love the fact that even after 10 chapters, each task still cost only 1 star, which is amazing! I do not feel this is a pay-to-play type game. I'm over level 100 and just lost my first puzzle. Like most of these games, yes, it does get more challenging as you go. The storyline is cute and so are the characters. Thank you for making a game that seems reasonable. It's so refreshing. :). Amazing!! Fantastic!! Love love love this sweet, adorable game!! I love everything about it, I can't put it down lol..the graphics are amazing..I love the characters..the bunny\ud83d\udc30 and \ud83d\udc27,the gingerbread guys, the penguin.. the story is so pleasant to follow.... I really love the chocolate turtles.. (I think they are chocolate) ,what a wonderful way to forget stressfull days!! fantastic job developers!! Keep up the great work!!\ud83e\udd70. Sweet Escapes has been wonderful. The gameplay is fun, the decorating is great and the characters are just adorable. That said, I think it's time for me to say goodbye. You can win lots of boosters and coins, but you need first time wins to do so. I'm beyond the 800 levels and I simply can't win on the first try anymore so I lose out on all the things that would help me. Still, I highly recommend the game. I'm sad to leave, but I just can't win anymore.. I normally cannot stand games where you have to gather stars in order to build/repair/cook etc etc.! Sweet Escapes, however, has me hooked! The graphics are really pretty, the characters are cute. I like the fact that each task only requires a single star to carry it out, though, I dare say this will change as I get further into the game. I can only base my rating on what the game is doing now and right now, I'm loving it!!! 5 stars all day long!. This game is captivating and fun. I immediately became addicted! Super fun and colorful, creative, amazing overall. I love all the different decor choices, so chic, retro, and classy. I definitely recommend this deliciously delicious app! Have fun (I'm sure you will!) decorating Sweet Escapes!. I love this game, I saw a woman say that she played 460 levels on her first day, she makes me feel dumb!!! I think the game is designed to make you spend money, however I guess that's what they set out to do!!! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Wish you got more rewards at each ten leveles though!!! You know, the spoon, the bottom row!!! I guess im slow!!!\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\u2764 Still learning though!!! I am 71 yrs old and I use it for brain excercise it makes you think!!! If you take a break and start again the next day you realize something new!!! The more I play the better it gets!!! I just think that you should be able to get more of the botom rewards, am I missing something??? I just got to the level 400, is that slow for a couple of weeks??? Just wanting more rewards!!!. sweet escape..wow what a game i just love playing it...i have reached level of 3500 still i keep on playing non stop....the only thing which i dont like in this game is the cupcake run..in cupcake run no levels are coming and we are unable to earn star for a week..which is really boring.... Edit- Im actually almost to level 1000 ! Actually since i posted that last update, im at almost 1300! I finally found a match 3 game i can stick with. Im at level 450 and normally im done when i hit level 100. Challenging levels, the ability to buy, but you can pass the levels without the extras,but with patience you can do without. I love the theme and it is keeping my attention. Usually i am bored to death, but the story line keeps you entertained. Awesome game. Adorable charachters!\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764. If you can developed a strategy it's a pretty fair game. Keeps you interested, it's fun and doesn't ask for a lot of money, graphics are great the only thing I dont care for is having to earn 2 star coins for each conversation or reading. Conversations should be free. Come up with some small decorations, menus, or clocks instead, please. I dont want to play to talk or read blueprints. I want to play to decorate only. I also like that most levels are easy and some are hard to, move levels along.. I love this game so much, I spend hours on it & never spend any \u00a3\u00a3 as it gives you 2hrs free every night & loads of 30/60 min unlimited play as prizes for finishing chapters. Play puzzle games, get stars, use to build a sweet village. Cute characters. Love the storyline, nice side game. Love how they keep introducing new elements to the puzzles - even on L1001 there was something completely new. Keeps it fresh and fun. OMG those turtles \ud83d\ude0d Nothing bad to say, I'd give it 10 stars if I could!. Fun game..but the last 2 days I can not get the game to play at all which has been frustrating!!! Haha and now when I go in to play I've got tobstart right from level one after I was on 300+. Whatever update you might have done has ruined the game it seems like it is on fast forward. Terrible. Think ill stop playing for a while.. 3/30/21 app is back to normal functioning! 2/2/21. The past 4 days the app is super glitchy. As a result of the glitches I have not received 2 prizes I earned and as a paying customer that is unacceptable. As of this morning the app will not even load it continues to crash. I will return my 5 star rating if the issues are resolved in a timely manner. --- This is one of my very favorite games. The purchase options are reasonable and optional. It is 5 star game play.. Such a fun game. It's not a time suck nor do you have to pay to play. I am maxed out in levels and have never had to pay a dime of real money. The only currency in the game is coins, which are easily got. The levels are just the right amount of challenging. It's very fair as far as giving out money and boosts compared to some other games. Plus the story is cute. Also no dumb ads.. I am Kathleen's daughter Stefa and I love this game! I love the Sweepstakes truck and filling orders. I love the cute characters, especially Buzz. I knew he was a softy! Some of the levels are a challenge but they can't all be easy. What's the fun in that? All in all I give it a big thumbs up! I really enjoy the storyline also. It is s super fun, enjoyable game. Never spent a dime and I'm on level 1115. Sometimes have to wait for lives but that is ok.", "neg_reviews": "I completely like the game. But it's so frustrating that it stops all of a sudden and the levels achived will be not saved., Option of watching video for extra moves wil not work, it restarts the game with previous achieved levels not saved. Very disappointing to give such a low rating. The issues given in review or feedback is never fixed. Worst Response.. 1st of all, the advertisment for this game is NOTHING like the game it's self, that's false advertising whatever you're going for. Secondly, when I try to use coins to continue the game, it says I must be online. Uh, I AM online playing this game. So I'm getting screwed out of being able to fulfill goals... I shouldn't have to clear my cache 3 or 4 times every time I play! I wouldn't bother downloading this game. It's literally a waste of space..... Complete Rip Off! I've been playing this for couple of years. It's a nice game to wind down with, cute characters and I love designing the shops. BUT I upgraded my phone last week and suddenly, 5 extra moves have doubled, DOUBLED in 'price'. According to the response I received this is because of the improved game play! I can't see any difference and don't see any justification for a 50% hike in costs. If it wasn't for the fact that I've spent my hard earned money to buy coins I'd bin it!. I have been playing this game for a while now. There needs to be a lot of improvement. Levels get harder but they are impossible to pass without investing money. And I do like the story line and interface but you need to improve. I have played till 300 levels and now it says I need to wait till Tuesday for more levels.. Think i will just uninstall this, it still wont load, wont work at all, joke, it goes as far as the loading screen and stops. I have played this game for a long time now, but as of today i cannot access the game at all. It freezes on the intro page and says ' heating ovens ' at the bottom then goes off. There's been quite a few things going wrong with the game lately. Its reaching the stage of being annoying after playing for so long and now can't even get past the loading screen.. I'd rate 5 stars but can't even get into the app at all! It keeps stopping where it can't even open when loading. I've tried everything on my end, I even reinstalled it & still won't let me in, over & over. I've been playing for quite awhile now & it's my favorite game & I've ONLY JUST started as Team Leader in the game & I can't even get access to it! Hope you resolve it asap or uninstalling like since your last update...4mos later another update and again same issue sigh! Smh!. Latest update was ok. Still having glitches. Still had coins vanish and weird cloud cover. Now it's crashed a couple times in the middle of the game and stolen my progress. It'd be helpful if lives didn't take so long to regenerate. But don't expect the game to stay fun. You will get stuck on levels for days. It's unfair not everyone on the team gets prizes from the food truck if they can't pass. Not being able to get past a level for 2 weeks still has me wanting to uninstall, I'll wait.. Update: The bug is still not fixed the game keeps crashing!!! I have spent sooo much money on this game and actually enjoy playing it daily for a year and you guys are ruining it for me. Please fix the bug!!!! Y'all need to fix this bug. My game won't even open, it keeps crashing. I enjoy playing it everyday for my mental health! Please fix this!!. You spend a lot of time playing levels only to waste rewards on things like talking to characters. Also if you can't clear a level in the required number of moves you spend a lot of time starting over or a lot of cash buying only a few extra moves. Also, on the mimi games, if I can't clear a level (unless I spend cash of course), it shouldn't make me start the whole mini game over. It's mindless and it does pass the time but it's also a heck of a big money grab.. EDIT to say I never heard a response from developers. I continue to lose levels, etc. I shouldn't have to connect to facebook to have a smooth game experience. I had an issue with the game, reported it to the developers but never got a response. My game booted me out wiped out approximately 1800 coins, a couple whipped creams & rolling pins, and all the progress on a 7200 point food truck task I was 5 sprinkles away from completing. I have spent money on this game but no more.. This is tough because I really did love this game. Played it almost from when it started. It use to be about fixing up shops and making things pretty. It is no longer about that because it got pushed to the bottom of their list. I HATE the cupcake run. Seems almost every level now is almost impossible to get through until you have spent a few days on it. You don't get to fix things up anymore. I am losing interest in it. FAST. And a played A LOT. My team is one of the top teams.. Money hungry developers. The longer you play and the more money you spend, the more they take advantage of you and the fewer perks you get. They took away hot cakes and are completely selfish with boosters. The only sales they have are $15 and $20 packages. And when you start the game each task only takes a star or two. Now each task takes EIGHT or NINE stars. Also the prize for finishing a chapter is a joke. You have to complete like 40 levels to get one popsicle rocket? Big deal. Uninstalling.. Updated 12/3 I love this game, but not happy with the update. A week ago this would have been 5 stars but now it costs more earned coins to get extra moves if you run out in a level. It almost doubled the amount, trying to force you to pay to play. The game keeps freezing after I win a level and costing me a life and sometimes money. I purchased extra moves and then finished a level more than once and it froze. Now I've been charged and don't have the coins or anything from the purchase.. \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 I have been stuck on level 690 for literally 10+ hours. I've used in app purchases... boosters... tears... over 100+ lives and I'm still here. This is INSANE! And it's stuff like this that will make me stop playing. I've put a lot of money into this game but I absolutely REFUSE to spend another nickel if this is what I'm facing on levels after this one. It's like you have to keep purchasing to advance. I can't do it. Smh. We should get maybe 10 \"skips\" for the life of the game.. Level 1649, one more object to collect, playing for several days. Most reviews say the same things, that the game has glitches. I haven't experienced it though. My issue is why does it automatically cut you off at the exact same place every single time? Stop the cheating people out of their hard earned money. P. S. You never looked into anything concerning this game.. This game started off fun. It didn't take long to realize that every day I'm being barraged by money grabs. I don't mind spending money on games I enjoy, but I DON'T like when devs make everything a ploy to make you spend money. I'm on level 500+ and instead of doing fun things like fixing up bakeries, we're forced to spend stars on tasks like \"sweep,\" and \"organize records,\" and \"mop up Scoops' mess.\" It's gotten ridiculous and the game is no longer fun. Uninstalling.. Liked the app nd game but only thing is these ad's r much disturbing .... That too of those kids who needs help (kitto hospital and etc...) See it disturbs pregnant ladies and kids who see these ad's kindly stop these things... After that I'll give 5 stars for this game..... Since getting a new phone the game has not worked properly. Contact the customer support. The reason for my game not working properly was that it was updated to a new version so that when I re installed it on my new phone it's like a different game no 2 hours of free play whole lines of tiles missing. I had purchased many ad owns including the season pass. What should increase your lives which it did not they told me that my tokens that I had one had been used when they had not. Very unhappy.. Frozen on the opening screen. Its like the 3rd time in the last few months this has happened.. even the updates arent fixing the issue.. So much for beating the sweetheart challenge. Can't play if you game is always frozen. I've spent a TON of money on this game, it used to be my favorite. Thinking it may be time to find something new.. This use to be my favorite game to play but the past week it won't load. I've sent feedback and no response from anyone. I got to play last night after I uninstalled and reinstalled, but then again this morning, the same thing was happening and it wouldn't load at all today. I lost everything including my team not once but twice now Since I last rated this app it has actually gotten worse. Occasionally i could get to play, but I haven't been able to get on at all since Feb 9th!! Time to delete!!", "pos": "Players love Sweet Escapes for its fun and engaging gameplay, praising the creative boosters and exploding combinations in the match-3 puzzles.  The ability to design and decorate their own bakeries, choosing from a variety of themes and desserts, is a huge hit. The game's charming cast of animal characters also receives rave reviews, with many players highlighting their unique talents and hilarious interactions.  The game is lauded for its balance of challenge and relaxation, with many finding it easy to pick up and play without feeling pressured to spend money. The regular addition of new content, such as the Sweepstakes truck and filling orders, keeps the experience fresh and exciting for long-term players. \n", "neg": "Players express widespread frustration with the app's persistent technical issues, including sudden game stoppage resulting in loss of progress, non-functional video rewards for extra moves, and frequent crashes. The game is criticized for misleading advertising that doesn't reflect the actual gameplay. Users find the in-app purchase system predatory, with exorbitant prices for extra moves and levels that become increasingly difficult to complete without spending money. The recent update is heavily criticized for doubling the cost of extra moves and introducing game-freezing glitches that result in lost lives and wasted purchases.

Now over 5000 levels and still have not made a purchase. This is my favorite game.. Up to more than 1200 levels and I still have not made any purchases. I've been playing this game for over three weeks, have finished over 400 levels, and have not had to make any purchases. It takes some time to finish some levels and sometimes I have to what for more coins but that becomes part of the play strategy. A very engaging game .. I've played a lot of the different Solitare games out there, and this is the one I've stuck with the longest. It is possible to play without buying anything, but the packages offered seem to give decent value for the money. Lots of different games to keep it fresh. Don't forget to pet the dog! ;-)Add: I dropped the game for a while as it was getting buggy from all the upgrades. Giving it a try again, but they started me at the beginning, when previously I was in the 1800 levels. \ud83d\ude21. Very addictive, interesting & engrossing game. I loved playing it. I even got an option of taking the harvest every half hour. However, you earn upto 4,000 & then the losing starts. So it's like getting addicted to gambling. I run out of coins frequently & then the temptation of the advert comes to pay & play. If you have to study for an exam or have urgent tasks to complete, then do not play with cards or marbles. I am not able to resist from playing this cards game, hence, I am uninstalling it. This is a nice way to kill a few extra minutes during the day. I have gotten stuck on a couple of levels until I can collect the harvest (every hour), but then seem to move on. So far, this has been the best solitaire game I have found. I love being able to win enough credits to keep playing. 5 stars for the simplicity and not having to make ridiculous purchases to play!. I love this game, it's a great time killer! This is also my favorite version of solitare. The only things I could say as a negative for the game is that as you progress further and further, the levels get more expensive and cost more credits to play, and most times I can only play a level once with each time I harvest. Its a small complaint, but otherwise a great game!. I play this game daily. I do enjoy it. My only complaint is that the amount if coin it takes to play a level vs what you can \"harvest\" in an hour; makes the game at some points futile. The reward after a level barely leads to profit as well. I understand that is nature of the games.. To have you hooked and to get you to spend money..which i have. I just wish they would up the rewards so that you could play even the side games easily without going bankrupt, literally and figuratively.. Very good game. At one stage at level 1594, the game changed. Had to reinstall. Was afraid if I would have had to start all over again but lucky enough to resume from level 1594. Thank you very much. I love this game! Only huge issue I have is that you hardly get any coins at harvest time and it takes most of them to play a single level, so if you lose- then you probably don't have enough for the next round. (Unless you just harvest and save repeatedly to build up coins.) ...Also, harvest is once per hour, but if you don't get around to it for a couple hours, it doesn't build up more coins. It just stays the same. But when I DO have enough coins to play a few rounds- I LOVE IT!!. **editing to add I am now on level 1147 and I am still loving the game** If you love Solitaire, you'll love this game, unless you are extremely impatient. (I'm on level 99) The levels are challenging, but not too challenging. The game play is smooth, the animations are fun. You don't have to pay to play, it's easy to gain credits, if you have just a tiny bit of patience. The graphics are easy to see (not too small, like you'd find on some games). I highly recommend this game.. Great game. Not to pushy with making you purchase things. And love the option of watching an ad for double harvest and 25%off the games. I tend to run out of credits a lot so wish there were more ways to earn but other than that. Graphics are awesome, always something new daily, and love the dice game. Should have that more often!!! Keep up the good work.... This is my favourite solitaire game. I've tried a few others but this one tops my list because it has plenty of ways to boost your credits / power ups and doesn't force you to watch ads (although you are rewarded if you do!) I'm very rarely stuck for credits, and if I am the \"harvest\" is never that far away. I just reached level 700 and the levels have enough variety to keep it interesting.. Really i like this game its very interest to play game. I got it more coin and rewards i suggested my friends also very very Super. But i lost my time\ud83e\udd23 I love the game. I absolutely love this game so much, that I nearly had a melt down when trying to sync my game from my old IPhone to my new Samsung galaxy . I didn't want to lose all of my progress.. I would recommend this game to everyone, it keeps the old grey- matter as sharp as hell , because when you get to my age (60) it's always a good thing to have your wits about you. Great game.. I love this game this is so enjoy able but its give very minute level of coins for playing solarite,we wants alot of coins for play more and more levels.. Obsessed! It's my favorite solitaire game to date. Something about the smooth, colorful design, creative game mechanics that force you to adapt your strategy from game to game, and daily challenges that are the perfect difficulty. I don't usually make in game purchases, but I've made several so I can keep playing this game. If I could change anything, it would be to lower how much the higher tier golden crop games cost, as it greatly reduces my game time if I lose a hand.. Great fun game. I was a little worried at first with some other reviews saying how they ran out of credits to play levels, but I haven't really experienced that and am over level 500. The game is strategic, though it is not possible to win EVERY time with the hand dealt, but it doesn't make a difference. There are plenty of additional things to do within the game that reap benefits, like credits. It's a great game that allows you plenty of free playtime. Solid 5 stars.. I have to give this app a 5 star rating. Excellent, captivating graphics. The course of play is quite entertaining and keeps me occupied for hours. The only - I can possibly see is the lack of instructions detailing the completion of crop levels. If you're familiar with this type of solitaire, you'll enjoy this. Big + very few (BUY ME) ads, and you can decline with ease.. Great game! One of the rare games today that doesn't bomb you with ads or force you to pay. Those who give negative reviews and complain about \"pay to win\" clearly forgot how actual \"pay to win\" games look like. If you lose your coins, just be a little patient and collect coins without playing and you'll have more than enough within a couple of days. And if you want to pay, you can. Just remember that there are developers who work hard to give you a fun FREE game. Be grateful.. Great game fun to play time killer. I enjoy it, sometimes it's easy, other times it a bit more challenging. Only problem is the sound. I can't get the sound to work, I tried and looked through my phone settings, the game settings and nothing works. Not sure if anyonelse is having this problem. But if so, please fix this bug. Other than that, great. Also this is not a money grabber game, I'm on level 1,498 and I did not spend a penny to get that far. So those people that say that are lying.. Absolutely hooked, brilliant still enjoying it. Still playing although finding it much harder. Not playing so much now cause the game needs to many credits. Tried starting again but it wouldn't let me.", "neg_reviews": "After my last review game got better...until now. As soon as you get close to completing a challenge you all of a sudden can't win anymore. I had 500,000 coins and went down to 124,000 on one board. Used all my extras and everything. R esponse to developer response: when all of a sudden you cannot win at all...and cannot build up enough coins, it loses its appeal. I was one of the 2 million followers, but without some changes I would have to uninstall. I have not yet but am close.. I used to like this game. Unfortunately, the game now runs like a casino. At my current progress, levels cost $6800 to play and my 60,000 credits were gone in two levels. The success rate is dismal making the game incredibly frustrating. Too many times, you blast through a level only to cycle through a dozen or so cards with nothing playable and you're left with one card left to clear. You could attempt a level 10 times with the same result. There's better solitaire games available. Just look.. The game is a great game, but the creator's are greedy it starts off good win plenty then as you progress into the game you start losing all your credits until you haven't got any left, in order to progress any further you have to buy credits, I refuse to buy credits to play a stupid game, so the game just ends up taking up space on your phone as you cant play until you get your next lot of free credits total waste of time uninstalling. This game could be super fun but you really can't play much at all. Harvest bonus is enough to play one board and is given every hour. You can get freebies from Facebook page which is enough to play just 1 game maybe 3 times a week. Every special event is not possible to win anything without spending a lot of $$$. Not worth your time at all!. Starts off quite fun but somewhere around level 60 the cost of playing levels and the need to buy extra cards in order to complete them (as the deck never has what is needed) just doesn't add up to the income. I need to spend a whole day harvesting in order to play a level once the next day. Also, despite disabling notifications the game is still popping up with them to advertise itself and get you to play, which is just bad. It'll keep you occupied for a couple of days but after that just delete it.. Three months ago, I would have given it 5 stars. Today, not so much. The creators have gotten greedy. The only way to really proceed, is to make in app purchases and they are not cheap. There are no .99 cent purchases. I'm talking 4.99, 5.99, 8.99 and those don't even last that long. Every hour you harvest crops, I for example harvest 14k in credits, to play a top level, it costs me 56k! If you are lucky, you can win a 30 minute timer (instead of an hour), but those are harder to come by now. They say the game is random, I disagree. I have never picked or spun for the top prizes. You can purchase a second spin for 4.99, but they lowered some of the prizes. The wheel would show 20xDouble credits. That has been lowered to 10x, but as mentioned earlier, I never win the better prizes anyways. Carrie the rabbit used to give you a wild card plus everything else if you were 5/5. She stopped doing that. When I first started playing, they had a side game you rolled a die to go around a board. Prizes on the board used to be 1k, 2k, 3k. Now they are 100 and 250. Don't even get me started on the costs of gems to build your farm. That is a whole other rip off! They disappointed me, I really used to love this game.. Fun to play but beware. When you reach the mid 5k+ levels, the power-ups you maybe used to, keep disappearing. At least that's my experience. Contacted help, they advised me to uninstall and some other stuff. Only uninstalling worked for a few days. Then it started all over again. I'm above 6k now (maybe you can tell I've played this game alot) and there it is. Some REAL fix needs to happen. I really don't want to have to uninstall every couple days. I'll just stop playing before I do that.. I liked this app and enjoyed it. But twice it has happened, My amount is debited but I didn't get coins, yesterday also happened same thing, for Golden ticket, Rs 450/- was debited from my account but I didn't get the golden ticket. Msg to customer care but no reply.. Waste of Time! The game seemed to progress normally, at first, but once I reached levels in the 30s, the game play changed. Now, after logging on, I can only play twice before I am harassed with ads to purchase a \"deal\" through the in-app game store. So I close those out only to return to the same screen and repeat the process. Back to the ads, then the home screen again. I am no longer able to progress without paying. Never have I played a game where you can't continue playing because of ads.. Definitely a pay to win game. Unfortunately for me I actually like this game. But in order to move up in levels you must pay for coins. If you don't pay you will sit at level and just move no where. I used free coins for 3 days and didn't win one level. Spent $15 and moved up 20 plus levels. And that is the honest truth about this game. Going to delete game after I use what I paid for. Gotta be a better experience out there.. This game is a good time waster and can be challenging. It can be very, very costly to get additional coins and they go so fast: you have to wait to build them up again, at least an hour, and then you don't get enough to play a round. You have to play at least 10 rounds or so for a chance to win 'bonus' coins. I've stop spending/wasting money to win 'coins' that ultimately doesn't amount to anything but self-satisfaction in winning.. One of my least favorite solitaire games I've tried. First, it's only ONE type of solitaire (Twin Peaks). Not one of my favorites. Strike One. It's a typical freemium game that fairly quickly becomes hard to play without regularly putting in more money. Other games use ads to let you still play...no option here. And I found the challenges very frustrating due to bad card deals. Overall...I did not enjoy the game very much or find it particularly fun for very long.. I have always enjoyed this game but at the higher levels I need more credits to play, it seems like it takes me several times and a bunch of credits to get through the level. Several times I have felt the deck is stacked against me. Loads of times I get down to 1 card, don't have enough credits to get 5 more cards, so either I buy credits or have to end the game! Have fun playing but is it worth it, is what I ask myself! Might just go back to JW Alive, that I could play without paying $$.. I been playing for a while, at first I was enjoying it and now I do not, It was a free game but I think it is not because you need to pay in order to progress more, its like a pay to win game. The random cards given at the end was I think bound for you to fail, even for buying the +5 cards make you fail the round. I'm sorry but I will uninstall this now because instead of giving me a good time playing it, it gives me frustration.. They desperately want you to pay to play. I am on level 62 and every HOUR I get enough coins to play a single game (2,000). One game an hour. Connecting to Facebook gives you 1,000 and you have options to text advertise the game for 250 coins. A truly awful system suffocating what is actually an interesting game with a lovely interface. Ruined by greed.. This game would be more fun if it wasn't for the greed of money in order to have an enjoyable experience! Constant rise in currency to continue to play with very little reward to compensate the time spent!! You may go on a run from time to time only to be repeatedly shut down waiting to gain gold from the \"free\" addition. Extremely frustrated with the upkeep without have to pay \"real\" money to pay!!!!. Your newest update SUCKS! Ever since I updated, I've lost my gems, my daily challenges & the farm I was working on. And I don't expect to get them back. What I do expect is EXCUSES, EXCUSES & MORE EXCUSES. I also expect to be looking for a new Solitaire game; which is too bad because this one USED to be fun. Used to be.. After playing for a few days and paying attention I see this game was designed to make you lose all your coins, winning only a few (and I do mean a few) hands. Almost every hand I play the first 5 or six cards I draw I can't use, the cost to play a hand increases with the cost of wild cards, and the cost of 5 additional cards when out increases. UNINSTALLED!!!. Interesting game, but becomes tedious when I lose a game because I'm not given the cards I need. It feels like the game manipulates it to make you spend money and therefore it takes any skill out of playing. You might as well download a slot machine game because that's what this feels like... The app decides if you win or lose, not your skill and the choices you make while playing.. I'm beyond frustrated with the lack of customer care and the fact your company refuses to fix their glitches and compensate for prizes lost do to those glitches. they will tell u it's been forwarded to the correct department (they have been saying that for over 4months.) then when u tell them u want it fixed as u are getting ripped off they try lying saying they checked and there's nothing wrong... please tell me how I'm on the highest level and only my prizes amounts are this low 5,000 credits?", "pos": "Solitaire Grand Harvest is a hit with players who love that it's a free-to-play Tripeaks Solitaire game with a fun farming theme.

The app is user friendly , the design is simple and welcoming, it gets to work the second you allow it to, and its honest! I was taught at a young age that the internet is a scary place and as a result, feeling safe while browsing was something I struggled with for years. Now that Norton is supporting me, all my fears lifted and I can honestly tell you that internet safety is NO longer a thought in my mind.. Norton Secure VNP allows me to feel safer and more confident when I use the internet at hotels and other public places. Although there are always threats and risks when using the web, especially on banking and other business websites, I am now learning more about how Norton Secure VPN offers the protection I need to transact person business. Very happy learning the benefits of this product. Thank you! MLJames. Feel super safe using Norton Secure VPN! I love Norton products. I've used them for years! Keep working to stay ahead of the creeps out there looking to hack us and spread malware Norton. I will always use Norton! Norton Secure VPN works seamlessly with LOOKOUT PREMIUM VPN too, after some software updates around May 2019. WILL ALWAYS TRUST MY SAFETY TO NORTON FIRST! And again, after a brief hiccup, I AM BACK to Norton Security Suite and Norton VPN. Perfect security answer for an average USER.. I would highly recommend Norton Secure VPN. I don't have to worry anymore Norton watches over my identity and protects my privacy. Thank You Norton, I don't know how I ever got along without you!!! The only issue I have is I was supposed to get a 30 day free trial, but when I signed up I was only given a 7 day free trial, but Norton is so amazingly awesome that I'm not really upset about it.. People are saying that you don't have to worry about smartphones getting infected with malware or other attacks. I have been using Norton for quite some time now. I am one who pushes the envelope! I have gone to known infection sites, click on one, and BAM, Norton grabs it, and warns me of the attack site, blocks it, and no malware. 5 device license let's me do PC's, phone, tablet, everything I own is protected.. Norton Secure VPN is an easy to use app that gives me peace of mind when I'm using public wi-fi. I've been using Norton security products professionally and personally since around 1991, when I was a methods and systems analyst, network administator, and programmer at Boeing. Norton has always been there for me. I trust them.. As of 2-1-2020... Since, loading the Norton VPN app to my cell phone and my both computers, my data stream Wi-Fi, is more secured. And, so far, has not lagged on the time on opening up contents from the internet... Good job, gals and guys; Keep it up! ... I've had used Norton products for years and I've been very happy with their services! Thank You, Norton! *Jvl, US Air Force, Retired*. So far so good I am curious to see what safety measures are taken for me, I've used Norton for years now and I have been happy with the service so, we shall see how Norton secure does it's job! Update:. Have been using secure for a while now and have noticed quite a difference in amounts of annoying ads... They are substantially decreased! Quite a pleasant surprise. Thanks. I have had Norton services for 20 years on my computers, two years on my phone. Since then, no issues of any kind on computer/phone, no privacy related attacks. Great reason to trust, I strongly recommend all Norton services.. To have Norton Secure VPN on all my devices is so nice! Not only do I have the security while surfing the net but I also have a support team on hand! The fact that Norton 360 works with LifeLock is a plus!. I was skeptical but took out the trial and it's actually pretty fast. Very stable much better than a lot of networks in South Africa. So happy there is a south African server. I like it could be just a bit cheaper though. This is what I think keeps people from buying and using a VPN. No ads for people that pay. So I can not comment on the amount of ads in the app. Pretty easy to use kinda figured it out with out much trouble at all. I do like that i can pick the country that I would like to be teathered to. And I often switch just for fun.. Excellet! Just one thing on my computer: I cut off my internet connection and place it on airplane mode then put computer in sleep mode. When I turn the internet back on, VPN is off & need to turn it on. Norton is great protection software with VPN & a security web browser. Safe search can be added as an extension to Chrome or U can use Norton's browser. Norton's Utility Premium also keeps my computer running great. It Tells U what is loading in the background & asks U if U want to correct!. I appreciate this VPN service, and I use it on all my devices. [edited to add] I know it's working because some websites hate it and force me to turn it off temporarily to see their stuff. Sometimes that helps me decide not to do business with those websites. Thanks Norton.. It has been really good so far. .I don't know if I have had a single drop and the speeds have been great for what I do. The whole suite of Norton products have been great. I had a breach in my home network and installed Norton afterward and feel very secure.. This VPN works awesome, Norton products have come really far in reliability over the years. I'm glad that I have made my recent purchases with Norton. Norton Lifelock and other products have saved me alot of anxiety and stress. it was just today that I got an alert that someone is using my identity and has been arrested using my information. I would never have known this without Norton. Thank you Norton and your dedication to people everywhere. GOD BLESS YOU!!!! \ud83d\ude01. Do not notice any delay, slowness to phone or internet connections. Can still use mapping programs for driving directions. VPN does not auto-reconnect when phone power cycled. Have noted that some ads are blocked, some links are also blocked (think these are re-directed links). Mostly I am satisfied that I am lowering my online footprint and making interloper monitoring of devices.. Pretty good. No slow downs, while surfing FB and web. Only issue, which is normal, would be video streaming and online gaming. You'll need to disable the VPN while streaming or gaming. Otherwise, great product.. Really easy to use, the only problem I see so far is that I can't set it up to start automatically when my phone and laptop start up. That's an option I'd like to see going forward; especially with this being a subscription application. Other than that, this app works really well, does what it says it will and is something I'd recommend anyone to get, especially for the low cost. You get a lot of bang for your buck here folks.. trust me, it's worth every penny!. Tried again in Feb 2020 and everything went through great!!! Thanks for your help plus I bought a new Samsung phone (that had to be a huge part of the problem!) It's fantastic and I would recommend Norton to anyone! Thankfully, I haven't been hacked by anyone from Russia (Siberia) again \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude0a", "neg_reviews": "Not able to select zero stars!!!!!!!! It just will not work at all. I am stuck in an endless loop. When I click \"GOT IT\" on the setup VPN page there is no \"OK\" on the next page. When I try to turn on the VPN it just goes back to the set up page and this endless loop of frustration continues forever. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling logging out logging in nothing works at all. I have a year subscription for software that I can't use at all. I'm done wasting my life on this. Thanks Norton.. I ended up paying full price because I unknowingly purchased the PC version, not the mobile version. The lady who \"helped\" me fix that said the discount code was for one time only and was no good anymore. I knew that was a lie but had to have a VPN immediately for work, so I paid full retail. That was 12 months ago. This month, the VPN turned itself off and insists I agree to the terms & policies all over again, and enter my user name & password. Which I forgot. So I have no VPN for work. FAIL.. I am not able to log into my account. I'm hung in a loop of security checks and password changes. Very disappointed with this app and do not recommend it. After purchasing the app it worked for a few days. When I try to log in the app doesn't accept my password and wants to verify identity, then directs me to my e-mail to reset my password. i return to app to log in with the recently created password. Once again the process is repeated, I'm never allowed to log in.. Terrible. I had to log in three times. Also when they ask you to connect from a mobile phone they actually display a QR code to scan...unless I'm missing something you can't scan the code if you are registering on the mobile phone. Also, why do I need so many apps to use the subscription I purchased? Vpn, Lifelock, security, etc. I get that you want to sell them a la carte but it's a fragmented system and I'm seriously considering leaving your ecosystem.. Turns itself off without any warnings. I would not rely on this at all. If Norton advertising states how important it is to be protected then why doesn't it warm you when it stops? Again, if it really is important to have VPN software then why doesn't it start itself after every reboot. We don't plan on renewing after the one year subscription is up. Internet reviews state some address leaks still leave one identified. Clearly this product is not ready for public use.. DO NOT DOWNLOAD FOR FREE TRIAL, you won't be able to cancel the subscription before the 1 week trial ends. Every step towards 'subscription cancelling', 'auto-renewal settings' and 'customer support' will take you to the same main page over and over again. I don't know how this is not scam and it's still on the official app stores, I just canceled the subscription from the app store itself but I wouldn't be surprised if the found a loophole to charge me anyway.. Norton VPN does NOT work. I can set it on my phones & it says it's there, but seconds later it isn't. Support takes forever to get through, then I'm stuck with someone who speaks English as a second language. Chat takes forever and results in a statement that someone @ the next level must handle it & that they will call me. But they don't. I've spent hours on the site & phone with no solution. I will not allow a renewal of it. OBVIOUSLY VERY UNHAPPY WITH NORTON 365. Diane. We have no idea how the vpn connects (method). 90% the VPN doesn't connect depending on where you are. Thank God it's free with your anti-virus but useless compared to other providers. Very basic from a security powerhouse. Plus when you try to connect and if you manage to connect, it takes over 50sec. No matter where and which server. Others connect in less than 5. Don't waste your money. If you're in the US or Europe, this will work but not everywhere. It seems good - when it works - but it won't always start automatically, and needs manually switching on. It also doesn't work with my wifi network sometimes, and from time to time the screen flashes so its obviously throwing up a few glitches. Perhaps it needs proper testing and development, and it's a shame to leave it to paying customers to take part in that.. Like a plane that shoots itself down. How many times does one have to install this app? I have a Norton subscription that I've had for years, on my PC the VPN is recognized, and it use to be recognized on my android Samsung Note 8. I think they just want to change an additional fee, even though it is included in my Norton subscription. That's always been the issue with Norton, it causes about as many problems as it solves. Just a suggestion, try making products that work, user friendly!. Really bad. It stops working without noticing making my device exposed. It's extremely slow. It must try to reconnect automatically or give a huge screen notice to be aware of the issue but it doesn't. It must reconnect automatically after turning off/on my cel or after an update. It is worthsless to hire the best guard in the world if he is sleeping. Extremely vulnerable!!!. I cancelled the day after activating the trial, because I upgrade my norton to norton 360 and this feature is included, but was still charged by Google for a subscription. Every contract email I have sent has been returned with an automatic response that says this email is not monitored. I am not happy at all with not being able to get a refund on this charge. They state there is a 90 day refund period. I now understand why. You cant get in contact with them.. What a ridiculous and useless app. Unstable, and wouldn't connect. I assumed it was because I was using a limited version during the free trial. So then I went to cancel, which was insanely difficult and wound up being charged for something I can't use. Tryi g to request a refund from my phone on the mobile website put me into an endless loop of new tabs being opened, without ever being able to request my refund. This comes off like a scam, which is a shame considering the Norton reputation.. I dont recall downloading this app ! I have 2 other security apps from you, but chose not to have this one. I find this has been on my phone, all the way on the back page, since June. I thought I had gotten rid of this when I saw the constant charges. I couldn't figure out where the charges were coming from. I thought they were from the app that was on my ancient computer that I recently reactivated. I suppose I now get to spend more time tracking down how to stop the charges & turn this off.. I cancelled + uninstalled in minutes. My experience sucked from the start. I accepted a free trial, then a create an account popup appeared. I select option to do it later. Then the VPN does not come on. I click Turn on VPN. Another popup appears, informs me to click 'OK' on next screen then I click 'GOT IT' to close popup. Next screen there's no 'OK' to be found. Back to Turn on VPN. Then process repeats. Looks like the app is forcing me to create an account NOW. IT'S A FREE TRIAL! NO THANKS.. I have to disconnect this app when using eBay, my bank, my credit card company and other very personal accounts otherwise I have to play their games proving I am me. Too much waste of time. Life is at the time in my life that I used up more than I have left so every minute counts. I wonder if Norton will fix this time waster. If not I may just stop using it and depend on my firewall. I have been using Norton for years, I like it better than a competitor with M at the beginning of their name.. I think this app is working but I'm never 100% sure! It seems to disconnect itself several times each day. I never know why or when & consequently I don't really know if it is working in the background, or not. It came as free addition to Norton mobile security but not sure I would pay for it. I am adding an update about 14 months after the original review. Unfortunately, this App on my phone still turns itself off & I'm still not sure if it works properly. Seems ok & more stable on my PC.. Update: since Norton's Jun 10th, 2021 update, this app has been buggy and not at all pleasant to deal with. It keeps kicking me out at random times when I think I'm secured and other times it won't let me sign back in. It goes in to some sort of loop logging in and then out without allowing me to use the product. It used to be an \"Excellent option for a quick, affordable VPN/ Cyber-Security solution. Extremely satisfied with its simplicity and user interface.\" These days seem to be gone!!!!!. I've had this app for about two years with out experiencing any problems, but this year, right after I paid my annual subscription fee, the app began acting funny. Whenever I login the app kicks me out. I sent an email to the Developer over a week ago and no one has responded. Cannot seem to reach anyone to rectify the problem. Poor customer service!. I've dropped my rating to 1 star. Everything about this app is a problem. It never enables automatically when on an unsecured network. I've spent a lot of time in places with a \"click ok to sign in\" networks, and getting this to enable is a manual and cumbersome process. It will enable on my secured, home network constantly even though that is the LAST place I want VPN. No whitelist or rule/location function. Spend your VPN money elsewhere, this is not what you are looking for.", "pos": "Norton Secure VPN is praised by users for its user-friendly interface and ability to provide a sense of security and anonymity online, especially on public Wi-Fi.

The app is very efficient and easy use (of course, that is what it aims to be). Indeed, it has many ads and if you want the app to be ad-free, you can subscribe. As for me, I don't really mind it. If I encounter any problems in the future (that even troubleshooting can't help), I would go back to this review and rewrite it. Have a nice day! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. I love this app! My phone was used to have soo many spaces and lag! And Can't install any games or something! But when I start using this keep clean. It free a lot of unnecessary spaces in my phone! And no more lags in my games! I recommend you to use this app!. I think this is a great app. Because whenever go to keep clean (This app) it shows me which app needs cleaning. And it doesn't even need signing up and stuff like that. The screen shows red if the apps REALLY need cleaning. It shows orange if it does need cleaning but not much, and green its completely clean! So if you want your phone to be clean and healthy, you should download this app.. KeepClean actually helps my phone cool down, speed up, clean junk files and free up space, check for any viruses and risks, etc. The app is really easy to use and the ads aren't long and they can be skipped once they pop up on the screen. I would like to say a big thank you to the creators and developers of KeepClean for making an app that has its users to easily clean and help their phone. Have a five stars.. If you are easily irritated, then this app is greatly irritating due to the many prompts, but one thing for sure, it's a hell of a good app to maintain your phone at optimum level and virus - free. Thank you guys. You did a very good job. Well done!. This app is amazing! I have used it before but I didn't really understand it..... I only just downloaded it and had charged my phone for about one hour.. after that I checked my charging history, it had went from 10% to 98% in an hour and 1 minute, compared to before I had had the app it would go from an example of 11% to 26%.... I would completely recommend this app! It also offers a variety of other things to keep your phone optimised!. This really works...had numerous problems with my phone. Thought I was going to have to get a new phone. For those who complained about so many alerts about cleaning, there are many options under settings to stop auto alerts and cleaning. I have all auto models turned off and once a day choose what I want cleaned. It is fast easy. Lots of ads though, and thinking about getting the paid version.. It's a good app with more cleaning parts that you really need for your phone. They deep clean getting junk files and other hidden files out of the phone so you have the free space then it's needed. This app surprised me on how well it really worked on my phone. So if you want a hard working, with all the right parts app give this one a try. It works great for me and it will work great for you too.. Don't hesitate to download this app! In my opinion it is the BEST cleaner app on Google Play!! My phone is actually faster & it deletes all the unnecessary files on my phone! I've tried a lot of cleaner apps. Most of them made my phone act up worse than it was before I installed it I can say this app is LEGIT!! It does exactly what it says it will do! So what are you waiting for ?!? Go get this awesome app downloaded now!! You won't be disappointed!! \u2661\u2661\u2661. Dis app is the best. I like it because of its features. From all of these, I like the game speedup option the most. If the option isn't available, I would have put only 3 stars. And I thank u once again for the best app u had gave. And finally, please remove the ads or just put very less apps.. This is surprisingly Working! When I deleted my 367mb game I search for sn app that cleans storage and then when I downloaded this app it says at risk and a red background I quickly scanned and found 3.52Gb on my phon so I cleared it and then i Downloaded my game IT downloaded! This is not a fake Storage app Cleaner that gives you just 1.32mb! (Thank you KeepClean \ud83d\ude06). Awesome app! I have tried quite a few similar apps, and I have found this particular one to be the best! It's very efficient, an it doesn't drain battery. Actually, it does quite opposite. Since I've installed this app, and started using it, my battery lasts much longer. Also, the recharging of it is much faster than before using this app. Before I started using this app, my phone was struggling and continually getting stuck. Right now it's flying! Thanks for such an amazing and useful tool!. Thank you for your quick response to my previous review! After trying several apps and being disappointed. I gave this one another shot. I am not getting anymore disruptive notifications. This app is much simpler and easier to use than the others. My phone works better when I use it. I don't mind the adds. Except the dating ad that popped up.. Its real cool because my first time on my phone I couldn't download anything because every time tried it said \"you don't have any storage on your phone. Please make space on your phone.\" But everything changed when I downloaded this app...IT MADE MY DAY!!!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f I really recommend downloading this app, you won't regret anything!!. This app is TOTALLY amazing and I love it when I get to the app it doesn't take \"FOREVER TO LOAD\" and also easy to use it the best app EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!. It's a very good app. One time I had a Internet connection problem only in my this device I scanned for virus and they told me something was wrong in my settings and they helped me fix it...I gave 5 stars. This is my favorite app. keepClean is doing pretty good. Ive been doing everything on it. I do the cpu, the speed up, the clean,and security scan every day. Even im a 9 year old its helpful. This is my mimis phone. She gave it to me. I have very cool things on it. Thank you keepclean for my phone clean. Your the best app ive had yet. Whoever made this app. I love you and thank you again for keeping my phone clean. It is an efficient apps which consists of *too many* features which normally I use the 6 main features there are clean up, fast charging, antivirus, junk & virus cleaner,free up RAM and phone cleaner (I have subscribed for about 3 months). For security wise it is really secured with the features provided and of course without advertisements will be the 1st choice for convinience sact. Congratulations.. It's so cool and helpfull app if there are many adds so off your data network and clean it and then after open it again it's very easy to clean my phones junk files, viruses,malware it's such a very good app Suggestions-all should install this amazing and helpfull app\ud83d\udc4d Keepclean\u2764\ufe0f. I was sooo unorganized. I had useless pics and vids. I couldn't load anything, not enough space! Now I can do cleanings and save battery... no charger included! My phone is now enjoyable! I love this app and while I write this I've had it for about 2 days and I already LOVE it. Highly recommend this to anyone who has a cluttered phone! Hope you download this app!", "neg_reviews": "I have used this app for a while and noticed that when freeing up storage space, it tells me it can free up 1.4 gigs of space but when I do this....and check to see Device Maintenance/Storage.....the App didn't free up anything..... However it does clean up everything else it lists. So far, this app isn't worth using till the issue is fixed. (+ 3-22-2021) Ads DISRUPT the scanning process, resetting the scan..... FIX this problem. (+ 3-7-2022) KeepClean windows constantly pop up. Very Irritating.. My friend and i both paid for this and can see it in our subscriptions... But we still have ads.. This is Scammy. Update, they responded... Yall, I have been stuck with ads this whole time... nice way to make extra revenue off me.. honestly shocking cuz it couldn't be that much. But I have paid and would not recommend others doing so. It's nice and all but I didn't know it would detete the songs I downloaded and it only made my phone lag more, so thanks for that, I just lost over 400+ of my songs and my phone is currently lagging ( Give me my songs back \u00d2 ~ \u00d3 ). I've encountered many cleaning apps such as the default Files By Google and other various cleaning apps. Here's the thing. Other apps may pick up only about 100 to 200MB. At the same time this app picked up and cleaned approx 1.8GB in one go. Plus it has extras like a game booster and security. It also has ads. Be warned of the spammy pop up every 10 minutes that'll cause whatever you're doing to crash. My device is high spec and still crashes because of that pop up. Avoid it.. Just a Spyware app. I mean just look at all the permissions it has. Like ignore battery optimization, and ask for your location. Oh and connect and disconnect your wifi. Oh and has read notifications. And many more spyware permissions. If you don't pay for it, your the product. It's as simple as that. So in conclusion, app developer, please tell me why you have these permissions... I bet you won't.. So many ads. At one point, I couldn't close the ad even after waiting for about 30 mins! I can understand the importance of ads but this is annoying and makes the app not all usable.. It's actually pretty good app \ud83d\udc4c, The anti-virus\ud83d\udee1 is very effective but the only problem is it's says many junk\ud83d\uddd1 but i have no junk, 2nd, the app has a bug\ud83e\udd16 when you use the boost\ud83d\ude80, 3rd, it's so many ads\ud83d\ude12. Sometimes the ads make the app so laggy, 4th, it says in the virus scan that my apps are installed in unknown apps even my messenger, they are installed in playstore, and for the last, it has so many spam notifications.Please fix this\ud83d\udd27.. Wow! This app is one of the worst ap I ever seen.this app doesn\u2019t deserves 1 star.this app cleans junk, photos, app files etc and I gave permission to access my storage. Every scan it detects 2 gb junks but after cleaning you will find all the photo in galley,app files in files app and all Cache in app.Not cooling my phone it showing that it cooling2 degree but in status bar themp is raising not reducing.i want to say the team plz stop making people fool..\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e. Good app,but i gave 3 stars cuz i have 3 problems: 1.too many ads,like every minute an ad pops up. 2.said it cleaned 1.60gb,i checked my storage,didnt give me 1.60 gb. 3.it won't let me clean anymore,i tried to clean but it took too long,im not impatient so i waited for 2 minutes,then waited for 10 more minutes,i watched youtube in the tv while waiitng,finished a song playlist,and still not finished..... well the app is actually okay, it cools down my phone, and makes more storage in my phone. The only thing that annoy's me is it doesn't have the exact same storage amount, when I go to this app it says 83% storage used, but when I go to my settings it will say 90% storage used, also this app kinda makes my phone acts more laggy then it already is. And the notifications are very annoying to deal with. Please fix this.. Your app is poorly organized. You should intuitively lead users through the process of cleaning their phone. You don't. Instead, users have to negotiate through a morass of confusing steps that ultimately leads them to an uncertain and unsatisfying outcome: \"am I finished?\" \"is that all?\" and: \"why is there an annoyingly persistent ad falsely telling me at the very end that my memory is full??\". \"Huh??\". Clearly, the app needs to do a better job leading users through the cleaning process.. I loved this and has been using it for 3 months but when i updated the app...it changed so much, is very frustrating when i charge my tablet and keeps on lagging and having a notification thing and only for portrait mode...when i was playing MLBB i was gonna charge my tablet and then it lagged so hard that i need to press the home button so many times...the only thing that is very useful and helpful is the battery protection.. Way to many intrusive ads in a way that makes it's use cumbersome. Also, to clean the memory, you need to stop and restart the option several times. Nevertheless, it does the job.. The worst app. First. I paid for this app, but many times the ads run a lot, I checked the subscription, and it said I already subscribed. Second. I have 3 devices that use the same Google account, but only one account has the subscribed status; however, it still becomes worthless for that only one device. Third, it depletes my phone battery so fast. My phone is Samsung Note 10 plus. I used to charge only once a day. Now with this app, I have to charge several times a day. Fourth, more issues.. Was a great app. Ads got longer and unskippable. Two ads tried to install apps without permission when I tried to hit the x to close it. Going downhill guys. Less likely to pay for this app.. it helps to clean my phone, but the ads, AAAAA, it keeps showing like when i clean and then after cleaning there's a ads will show, the app is good, but the ads is \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc. I had been using this app for a few years, and it was doing its job. I didnt mind the ads afterwards. However, recently the ads have gotten worse. They interrupt the scan with everything I try to do, multiple times while trying to do it, and make the scan start over. I can no longer use the app because of this. A bad app. You know what, this makes my tablet memory filling more. Instead of this app, trust your own tablet and clean up your phone with personal apps instead of fake app. Its a baddd appp dontt downloaddd. This app is the worst I've ever had... It gives useless notifications and viruses are still on my phone. When i try to remove harmful files it just takes me to a page that says no internet. I dont recommend downloading this app. Literally been only two days since i used it and i am fed up.. Everytime I tried to clean my device ads would pop up and interrupt the cleaning which would then start over. And ads would take me to different pages when I was just trying to clean my device, making it a hassle. Learn how to place ads. I immediately uninstalled and don't recommend unless you don't mind pop up interrupting.", "pos": "KeepClean is a highly recommended phone cleaner app that users love for its effectiveness and ease of use.

I've been playing since the start and it's still a blast to play. And I love, love, love the social side of the game. I have met some awesome people through it. Edit, 8/23: the most recent update is riddled with errors and glitches. The same errors and glitches that have come up before in other updates. Making gameplay really difficult. I keep closing the game out of frustration. Just putting a favorite star on Pokemon makes the collection go back to the top.. It's been useful during this whole quarantine thing I finally have something to do. Helps get me exercise by going on walks. The graphics are amazing and, it's completely kid-friendly. However, I think that there should be a fix on how bad the lag can be sometimes. But that's about all I got to say for this app momentarily. I look forward to Future progression! This is one of the best apps I've ever really played. I think more apps should be like this rating 10/10. Good job, keep up the work.. I love this game, but I know it has the potential to be even better. It's taking too long for the Alola Pok\u00e9mon to be added to the game. We finally have a game that syncs up with the real world, yet Castform, doesn't change to match the weather. For Deerling, and Sawsbuck, this game has the ability to change things up, and be the first Pok\u00e9mon game to have them sync to the seasons. I like the addition of lyrics to the background music, maybe add a set of options though.. Used to be more of a tech demo.... But still fun to play with. Nowadays there's a real game here with the excellent pvp battle league - it's definitely got a learning curve, but it really does give me a reason to catch them all. Also there are often interesting events going on. Very entertaining, makes the game fresher. In app purchases aren't too pay to win. Time, location, and brains are the biggest factors. I hope they continue to put the work in to make the game great!. Great game but the street maps dont load for me. For me its the only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars. Other than the traditional lag at times during raids, great game! Edit: If you have problems loading the street maps(sidewalks, terrain, etc.),go to your device settings, clear data (not cache). You will then have to re-login to POGO. Then your maps should be loaded correctly. The game will take a little longer than normal to load after you delete data. I've done this 4 times and works like a charm. I have given the 5th star for the rating, amazing game!. I absolutely love this game. It's fun to play alone or with 1 or more friends, I really enjoy the fact that I can have a full Pokemon conversation with all of my Children and actually know what I'm talking about \ud83d\ude01 \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd13 Update: it's been over a year, playing daily and I Still cannot get Enough ! You all who've developed and continue to upgrade and make this game even more epic, you all are awesome and your imaginations are endless. Thanks! Update: U are my Covid sAniTy! Update: \ud83e\udd2a. Fun for ALL ages! It might seem like a kids' game, but as an adult, I l've found that the augmented reality adds a challenge and realism that I really appreciate. It doesn't require money to advance or enjoy any part of the game (although its very tempting) and it's great motivation to get out and get a little fresh air. The game has increasing difficulty with some very long term goals. I didn't think it would keep me entertained, but its been over 6 months and I keep coming back to play.. Been playing since 2016. The game keeps evolving and getting better with more optional elements so it can appeal to all ages with each player choosing the elements of the game they like best. You can play it as a simple \"collection\" game,or dig deep into strategy. Niantic did an amazing job during global pandemic lock downs making the game more home-play friendly. That really impressed me. Plus there always seems to be some special event going on to make things interesting. Easy to play free.. Well, recently it's not loading! It's stuck on the Nitanic screen. Other than that, it's really fun and the graphics are quality made! I live right near a poke-stop too, so I find a lot of pokemon all the time. I haven't been playing recently because it needs a lot of updates in order to function properly, it takes a lot of space so that's the only downside to the app. Other than that it's great and you actually get exercise walking around everywhere!. I used to have issues, but since upgrading to a better phone, game has given me no problems. I've read a few of the lower reviews, and I'm pretty sure there issues aren't the game, but the fact that there phones really can't run it well. It'd be a shame to ruin the experience for everyone else, just because your phone is not completely compatible with go. Far as the devs, really need to reevaluate what is actually compatible with go. And not allow phones that can't run it to download.. I've been playing since it's second week and you guys have done a great job refining the game. From its UI and smooth framework, it's being improved with every update and it keeps me entertained at all levels. One thing I would recommend, though, is if you can work on a Pokemon Pro (the wristband device) for the Wear OS smartwatch or compatible watches. That way we can keep up with catching Pokemon as we go. No problems, no hassles. Hope for greatness and good luck. Thanks.. So much fun Love this game! App runs great on Android too! Great for kids! My 4 year old can even understand it. It's simple but also can be advanced & challenging the more you level up. Great for all ages . You will eventually have to spend money on it and it can be spendy but it's worth it. It brought me and my husband's whole family together. Now we hike & adventure together to collect pokemon and stay in contact across the states with this game.. I absolutely love the game itself, I see other people have shared experiences with many bugs. I wasn't really experiencing any problems until recently. It has started crashing all the time and failing to load. I'm wondering if you have advice about phone settings that may help while the bug fixes are happening? I've restarted my phone, put the app to sleep & re-opened it, checked for updates, etc. Should I unistall & reinstall it? Game is super fun and nostalgic, would love to see it improved!. Pok\u00e9mon Go is a great premise and I have enjoyed playing it since it came out. When the pandemic hit and the distance to stops and Pok\u00e9mon was increased to help allow more people to play safely, my game experience massively improved. Niantic has now reversed the spinning distance back from 80 m spinning distance to 40 m which greatly limits my ability to play the game effectively. Please put it back. Update: Niantic listened to the fan base and permanently changed to 80 m. Thank you!. I've been playing this for years now and it's still one of my favorite games. I also just wanted to pass on an idea for an update? It would be really cool if you added a way to trade a certain ount of candy for a rainbow candy, like either 25/50/or even 100? Just as a way to use up candy collects. I have over 800 Eevee candies that aren't ever going to get used \ud83d\ude05. Great. They added the ability to skip past the egg hatching animations. 5 stars now.. I have been playing for almost 2 years now and it is just as fun and interesting as when I first started. Lots of different types and areas of gameplay, updates include new content and characters everytime, and game experience scales depending on player level. So there is something for everyone, not just fans of the show or earlier versoins of the game on other platforms. I play with friends my age and with my kids too. I am approaching end game content and never needed to spend $ to progress.. Really good Pokemon game, I found it very exciting because of the variety of Pokemon. I also really like that the game has smooth gameplay and easy rewards. The raid battles, trading system, and friend battles are really cool when it comes to interacting with other players. Overall a really good game and I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes Pokemon.. Great app! Love to play this when I'm going on road trips or exploring new places! The only thing that I dont like is that I wish there was an offline version for the people who don't always have the best connection. There was also a glitch that I found. Sometimes i try something on for my avatar but it won't show up. Mabey it is because of the outfit I'm wearing so it won't show up. If anyone else has this glitch please get it fixed.. Why half the interaction distance with health concerns still high? Doubling the distance was a great idea. It helped with several misplaced pokestops in my area that are an accessible due to misplacement or closed access. People do silly things sometimes to get to some of these stops. I did not see that happening in the last year. This decision should be reversed with a rise in the d variant. The interactive distance is too small.", "neg_reviews": "It won't run on rooted phones, and that's any phone I'm willing to use. I don't cheat, but use root for many other reasons, and don't like being treated as a criminal for wanting some control of the devices I Own. Especially when the true cheaters don't even need root! It's not fair.. GPS not found error, spent hours trying to fix it, giving every permission, etc. A total fail from the start. The download worked for droid, but the app is a bust. After re-installing 3 times, I'm done. deleting for the last time and will not try this app ever again. You'd think after several years that the app's development would be better, but its not!! Hire some people that have some idea how to create a product that works.. USED to be a fun game... However, you will not get less customer care from anywhere, this company doesnt care. Cheating and utter DYSFUNCTIONALITY of the PvP. It feels like after THIS long we would be operating smoothly, but its as bad as ever. We have the technology, the money and plenty of time, its just laziness. Where in the app store does it say its #1? Ask for less of us and DO more, FOR us. Pvp is NEVER smooth, ever, the only competetive part, NEVER FUN, HOW YOU LET PEOPLE CHEAT ALWAYS. This app requires a high-end phone if you want smooth, problem-free gameplay. I should know because I don't have a high-end phone and my app crashes and freezes constantly. The frame rate is also abysmal ever since the \"real sky\" feature went live. I like that the app encourages physical activity, and I enjoy hunting for shinies. That is pretty much the only positive thing I can say about it. I shouldn't have to own an $800 phone to be able to play this game.. Silent notifications wake the screen, even though I had the Android OS mute them. Give us an option to disable screen wake on notification, or I might turn your marketing notifications off entirely. Also, the GBL encounter rate for Tapu Koko is so low, you would have generated less ill will if it weren't there at all. Same for the low catch rate for the incense legendaries on Johto Day.. Hello developers and financial team of this game,without any doubt the game is very good and addictive to play. We can ignore the bugs and glitches but the most annoying thing is why all of the gamers in my town never installed this game to play is \"pay-to-win\" system. I understand developing game is not an easy work but because of money please don't force your hard work into trash system and either try making the game fully paid or leave micro transactions for only customization not for win \ud83d\ude42. I truly by heart USED to love this game but after the Alola update it has become worse. 1st of all the game lags more. I was in Jhoto cup just now and i was liteterally winning while putting up with the time taking of charged attack to activate. The game lagged so BADLY that i just cant play this properly anymore. It says my internet connection is weak but i can smoothly play other games which have way more data usage. This is really annoying so plz fix thos right away.. All my 1 star or 2 star reviews are being deleted after short periods of time which makes the actual stats of reviews seem false for me. The app has to be restarted consistently because it's always freezing or lagging. Thus, robbing the customer base blindly of the money they have to pay to be able to continue to play. All in all, the fun doesn't outweigh the questionable things about the app and how often it doesn't respond. But being a fan helps to 0verlook things..

All in all, the fun doesn't outweigh the questionable things about the app. But being a fan helps to 0verlook things.. Been playing for a while, since 2016. At this point, Niantic doesnt listen for anything, the game is unplayable. It freezes, it crashes, the battle league is a joke full of people using cheats for cheap wins, and as of now I can't participate in raids or battles because it freezes and crashes every time I try to join. Instead of adding more and more features to lag out a buggy game, fix what you have! It was fun while it lasted I guess.. No attempt to fix the hordes of major bugs and countless network errors. Instead they continually shove pointless stickers down our throats which no one wants. Niantic is entirely clueless as to who their audience actually is. A lot of work needs to be done. Not just gimmicks.. Doesn't listen to player base. Awful UI, makes things harder / waste more time and doesn't try to improve upon them. The idea of the game was to explore your environment, but that's basically impossible if you're staring at your phone trying to send gifts to all your friends one by one. Everything is needlessly tedious. Full of bugs. Bugs I've seen since its early days have still not been addressed in some cases. This game would be a lot better if another company was handling it.. I have been playing since launch and it has improved, but only barely. There are still tons of game-breaking bugs, support is heavily lacking, and the developers ignore any feedback from the community. They've also starting implementing more features that encourage spending money, such as making all events require a paid ticket (usually only $1-$8, but it adds up and the rewards are not worth it). I really want to like this game, but I honestly can't defend it.. I would not recommend this game for newcomers. The more time and money you invest into it, the more it is apparent that the developers are not the AAA game studio they should be for a game of this caliber. Bugs are added with almost every release, and some bugs within the PVP system (GBL) have persisted for the past 2 years since it was introduced. It is a fun game for walking around and catching pokemon, which gets boring after awhile. As soon as you get into Go Battle League, raids, etc, the more frustrating the game is, not to mention it has become very much a cash grab as far as games go. I think one of the biggest issues for me, that highlights the mentality the developer seems to have is that this is a community game (it even has a community day every month), and yet there is no in game support for anything community based. Pokemon go communities live on other systems, like Facebook and discord, and not within the game. Finding players and adding friends can be a challenge in 2021, not to mention you have no way to communicate with friends to coordinate gifts, lucky eggs, etc. If the developer fixed the bug and lag issues that persist within GBL, I would give this 3-4 stars. But those issues make this game more like a habit you are afraid to kick for the fear of missing out on their next pokemon, and less like something you enjoy playing.. This was my favorite games for a while. However, it seemed with every update the battle mechanics became clunkier and had more lag. This game also requires a LOT of time/money in order to stay relevant, and if you're to busy to take part in an event, than you are just flat out of luck. I would love to see if niantic could smooth out the gameplay, and be more forgiving with people's busy schedules. If they can fix that I'll happily change my review to 5 stars.. Time to uninstall. It's not a bad game. It is just nearly impossible for rural players to make progress. I've played for almost 2 years and can't seem to get past the grind. Fair warning: it is VERY grindy. Now all my research missions involve battling other players or catching a pokemon I haven't seen in almost a year. The new matched battles don't count for special research. The makers effectively ended my game for me.. Nice game but it is the worst I've ever played it always shows some thing error even you have net or turned on your location but it shows error.While battle I feel like I should not ever battle.And please keep one gym and some poke stops in Andhra Pradesh,vishakapatnam,Anakapalli,Thummapala and other rural areas please,then I will give 5 stars.. The game is fun, but here's something that I really think should be improved; Pokemon you get from Research Quests. Some people got terrible IVs for their Mew. Mine weren't terrible, but definitely subpar. My Gardevoir is more impressive. This quest took me over a month to complete, and it being less than 100% perfect feels insulting. And don't say you can't control the IVs, I know that's bs. Edit: too glitchy for gyms. Game is a fun idea, poorly executed on anything other than apple. I want to play with my friends but the difference in quality is too great. Don't make the game for multiple platforms if it's only optimized for one. Used increased distances to help with COVID restrictions and pulled them back, regardless of the pandemic still raging.

So far it's probably one of the best mobile RPG games I've played.. It combines RPG elements, with simple mobile mechanics. The power ups are a lot of fun to play around with, and it's a blast when you finally get that perfect combination and are just watching everything melt in front of you! It can be a little challenging at first, but that makes it fun as well.. Also, a good plus, is that you don't get bombarded with ads.. You'll definitely want to support this game!. Very fun game. I think the level difficulty, prizes/rewards, and stop-to-shoot aspects are perfect. The third level even changes up pace with the waves which keeps the game fresh. One part I think should be added is the ability to actually see what upgrades are doing in a quantitative way. For example, the critical damage has a \"minor\" and \"master\" but I have no idea what that actually did. I think the wait time for \"lightning energy\" is a little drawn out as well.. I don't even like many phone games but this one is really fun. Most phone games are mindless and really easy. But this game, progression starts to get pretty hard by the second world(?) but I never feel like I'm not getting anywhere. I love that every start is fresh and random enough but with plenty of strategy. All around very satisfied, especially for a free game!. I love this game, it's a super unique experience with so many ways to play. This game has almost no flaws. I love the fact that there are multiple characters and how each level is unique. I picked up this game, and now I can't stop playing! But there is a huge flaw... the energy system. It forces you to either watch ads, spend gems, or wait, I'm willing to spend 5 bucks for infinite gameplay, just let me continue the game. But either way i highly recommend this game.... Not a bad game. pretty fun gameplay but the difficulty curve is a little intense. I think either scaling it back or increasing equipment drops would make this an excellent game. *Edit* Now the longest I've played a game but I'm having the same issue that most people have, level 7 is too hard. Need more equipment to drop or tone the difficulty down just a touch. I like the new additions though. This game is a lot of fun.. I'm in love with this game. So much fun! It has some very rare qualities. With most games, there are different qualities of equipment. (For example: Common, Great, Rare... etc.) Well, the same goes for this game. However, in most games when you aquire a better quality equipment and replace the old, all of the loot you spent on that previous one practically goes to waste. But Archero, actually let's you trade in the old equipment and get a refund for ALL of the loot you spent on it! No lost loot!. Great fun, great gameplay. Developer works hard to keep content fresh and the game challenging. I have played for a while now, and found that the free to play is excellent in this game, it does give a few options to watch some ads for extra items. Compared to other games, this one keeps me engaged continually. Highly recommend for anyone looking for something a bit different.. Not gonna lie, this game is very good for what it is. I've had no errors, except for once an ad didnt load. But who cares. Graphics are changeable, and you are given an option to show less coins, which helped my phone speed. Multiplayer is smooth, some phones may differ due to RAM or hardware or internet access. But I would reccomend this game to anyone. They make it an option to pay but you dont need to pay to get good. And an option to grind which I like in rpg's. I consider this one kinda.. Love the game. Its come a long way. Controls are smiple and easy to use. Not to mention the menus are simple and easy to navigate. Upgrades given are good. But in my opinion they should have description, at least a simple one and not just by \"obvious\" icon description, so that players know exactly what they are upgrading. Other than that. Graphics are good. Runs smooth. Customization and upgrades have also improved. Overall. Very great game. 5 stars all around. My most favorite game!! I give the controls 5 stars. The game play only 3 stars because the game its self can be a bit glitchy, a long with ads. Sometimes after watching an ad my whole screen will go black and I have to start the game over. I simply try to avoid the ads when I can. And last I give the graphics 5 stars because this game is awesome. Please keep up the good work, maybe add a sandbox mode where you can make your own levels, that would be cool. Thank you.. I love this game to be honest. The concept of needing to be stationary to attack is really interesting to me. The balance of luck and skill in every game is great, where even the best players can get stuck in a bad run and have to improvise while weaker players can sometimes end up with great chance and make it through a hard chapter. There aren't too many ads unless you choose to use them, I think. The little in game notifications for upgrades can be annoying, but that's a personal preference.. Archero is an enchanted hybrid between a top view shooter and dungeon crawler style game. Shoot through waves of enemies and survive as long as you can. This game is nice. I love the main menu music, love the gameplay, love the power-ups and pets who assist you on your quest, and there's hardly any ads. My only critic would be the lack of background music in the gameplay makes it feel a little bland. But overall it's a good game.. The one that every game like this tries to copy. Archero presents an almost perfect balance between challenge and reward. Great graphics, smooth gameplay, a wide variety of enemy types, and a straight-forward progression system. I do wish that the in-level rewards weren't quite so stingy, and I would love to see a mode with no level cap, but these are tiny gripes about an otherwise perfect game!. By far one of my favorite games. An amazing balance of challenging, without becoming redundant. Currently on chapter 5 of 12. I really wish there was a coop mode for me to play with my best friend, or even be able to trade equipment. It can be a little difficult when trying to get scrolls or item drops to upgrade and fuse equipment at times.. Love it, I just cant get enough of it. Great set up and and graphics. I have noticed that in higher levels to beat all the way through final stage without losing you either need to be upgraded to a certian point or get the right match up in selection when you level up, which is awesome. My favorite set up is, multi-shot, bouncing wall, double-shot, ricochet, then corner arrows followed by plus attack or side arrows and backside arrows. Than nothing but plus attack or plus health.. Surprisingly difficult to start out with since you don't have any protective gear at all but it's mainly about choosing the right boosts to keep you alive at first. This is not an auto-battling, or choose a command type. You have to use strategy and keep moving around to not get hit. It's kinda addicting and the strategy makes it fun.. Hands down the best free to play app game I\u2019ve played. The user interface is simple and effective, and I like the different gear options. I really enjoy games that allow you to level up outside of a \u201crun\u201d and make your character better and better so you can continue to improve and get futher. This game does that very well with being able to level up equipment and unlock higher permanent bonuses for your character. There are also more options than I would have expected for different weapons and the spirit companions are very cool. It\u2019s also great that you unlock more abilities in every new chapter! One of the best things about this game is that I can really tell that the devs are putting a lot of time and effort into it. I have noticed several updates that made smaller changes and they just added timed events and the ability to level up each individual character, both of which are great! My only critiques are: -I think items should drop a bit more frequently. Getting item drops during a run is a lot more exciting than just waiting for/paying for chests. -Some of the enemy\u2019s attacks can be hard to see at the higher levels when you\u2019ve got tons of upgrades causing your attacks to explode and bounce around and cause other effects. It\u2019s kind of fun in a hectic sort of way but it would also be nice if somehow they made them projectiles a bit bolder for some of them. -I wish that the free chests were just once per day and once a week instead of once every 24 hrs and once every 7 days on a timer. It\u2019s kind of annoying to have to remember that you opened the chest yesterday at noon so now you have to wait til noon of the next day to open it again. It\u2019d be better if it just reset every day at 12am. Lastly, I\u2019d love to continue to see more equipment items being added. I seem to have gotten at least one of everything I can get (maybe you can get more things as you continue getting to higher levels?). They\u2019ve already exceeded my expectations but more variety would be great! I\u2019m sure they\u2019re working on it though.. Very fresh mobile game in the way that it has very engaging and challenging gameplay without being so difficult that the only way to win is to pay. There are microtransactions (of course) but they are all optional and do not feel like they are necessary to play the game. Ads are no invasive and are only played when you opt to view them for rewards. Gameplay starts fast and gets more difficult as you grow stronger. Admittidly, progressing does get a little slow but grinding is fun and rewarding.. Really fun game that's kept me entertained for a long time. The graphics are good, the controls are easy to understand. Gameplay is all together pretty decent, although I feel it gets a little grindy the further on you go but I like that. The mobs are pretty decent and can pose a good threat at times and the bosses are okay but I find myself getting caught up more on just the regular mob levels then the boss levels.. Its a fun and difficult game that causes your brain to have to think. I would like it if in the next update you could set it so that if the hero is behind cover it doesn't get hit by projectiles being thrown by the enemies. But overall its a fun game. I love that you added in being able to revive once by an add since getting gems when spinning the lucky wheel is fairly difficult. Excellent job creators! Keep up the good work!", "neg_reviews": "Fun until you get to arena 3. It's impossible to pass this level without spending an unreasonable amount of time grinding, money, or watching ads. It was fun until they made it nearly impossible to pass with just skill because of the overwhelming amount of projectiles. Also, the energy system seriously limits the playtime for the game, when I just want to play for fun, not for achievement. Edit: Generic and automated responses are more insulting than not responding.. Very disappointing, it's very addicting and fun, but in the end it's just another game that starts fine and proggressively becomes pay to win. The later game resorts to throwing an overwhelming amount of enemies instead of just stronger ones making it impossible to move around, fight them with your weak weapons or just tell whats going on. This makes each game around 1-2 mins long. And with how poorly optimized the energy system is you have to wait a full hour just to play for 1 minute. Finally decided to uninstall this game. Seems like you reach level 5 and no matter what upgrades you get for your weapons they do very little damage. I understand that the need to generate revenue from purchases through the game but after reading some other reviews even when people purchase upgrades seems like it makes no difference. I've noticed also certain enemies projectiles don't even seem to touch you and they drain your energy. It's been fun while it lasted \u270c. Pretty fun game. I dislike any control scheme that makes my thumbs block the screen though. Edit 5/23: I took away a couple stars because they pushed an update that disabled me from playing when offline/airplane mode. I used to be able to, but none of it would count toward progress. I didn't have a problem with that, because I was offline and it didn't use energy either. Now I'm only able to play if I have service but the whole point of installing it was to have something to do when I don't. Edit 5/26: Took another star off for that dumbass response.. The game starts to just throw more enemies at you instead of stronger ones. It gets to the point where you can sometimes barely tell whats happening. It gets so bad that you almost shoats need the ricochet ability! Also please fix the AI so my character doesn't try to shoot at an enemy thats behind a wall just because they're the closest one! Remove healing from the boss prize wheel nothingnis worse then beating a boss, bosses already drop healing orbs! So most of yhe time I'm already max hp!!!!. previously a 5 star review. I can find no reason to continue to play this game. It was fun for awhile until you can no longer progress or upgrade equipment. I have been in a mode of only playing enough to get my free spins for some diamonds so I could get new gear. I realized how pointless this has become. No way to progress in the game so no point in playing. Can't even grind gear because drops are rare and grinding levels is stopped by a 4 play energy bar.. Good game but FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. The advertisement makes it seem as if it is a tower defense or strategy based game, it shows that you can lay down blocks to direct the enemies to the archer, but unfortunately you cannot. Idk if this feature is available later in the game, but the reason i downloaded it is because of the way the advertisement made it look, but it is not like advertised! If you ever make a mode like this in the game it would be a 5 star game.. All the additional content has been really great development for this game. Unfortunately it's just a mountain of ads to get basic daily rewards. Theres already microtransactions and it's just overdoing it and unattractive. I would play so much more without the constant push for ads. UX needs help bad. Abilities have no description and requires google. Cant see what abilities you have when choosing new ones. Cant see own stats during a stage, attack, attack speed, crit, dmg, etc. Please improve.. This game is good, but the gameplay is getting on my nerves especially the latest eskimo lands where you keep on facing bosses but still getting only one abilities per fight. Its so stupid and making me lose my interest to play this game.. This game has the potential to be amazing, but the developers genuinely pay no attention to the players. Its a good free game and it becomes a very much grinding experience further down the line. Various events are worthless and the in-game purchases aren't really worth it. The PvP system sucks as does the online 'co op'. There's been many suggestions on various forums to improve the game, but it's never acted upon.. The gameplay itself is entertaining and provides a good level of challenge. The biggest issue I have had with the game is that there are a ton of ads and nudges for microtransactions in the levels and while you are spec-ing your character. I have also had problems with not recieving items that I was supposed to have earned, like the daily login rewards, or the patrol rewards, just not showing up. Its not a bad game, it just isn't very focused on providing the best experience for the player.. I really wanted to rate this game higher, since I've had fun with it in the past. What has really ruined the game for me is the ridiculous scaling in difficulty of the daily challenges, and the inexplicable varying degrees of difficulty between chapters. There really should be more variety in the daily challenges as well, it's boring. Chapter progression in 13 and 14 have made the game frustrating. The only way to progress is to get the correct abilities, which happens far too infrequently.. Too many issues. Very fun at first, but it gets really annoying when I battle through the levels after hours of work, only to lose all progress because of an error message that claims I am using 3rd party apps and cheating. I don't even know how to cheat. Then other messages of supposed network errors frequently occurs, deleting my progress. However, if I quit the game and enter Google to see if I have connection I absolutely have. Restarting the game does not help at all.. The game is a lot of fun in the beginning. The most glaring issue is that the upgrade pool becomes so polluted with useless abilities , that your run can be totally ruined before it even begins. There needs to be a way to get rid of useless upgrades, and they're also should not be a level cap during a run. The other problem is as you progress there is no way to increase your defenses. The later monsters hit way too hard.. The game starts very well, but after a few weeks you pretty much hit the limit-no matter your skill, you will not progress, unless you spend ton of money on equipment or replay levels 100500 times. Which leads to very bad experience. I just want to finish the game, and if I liked it-replay it. Not replay it again and again to finish it. I even payed for season pass, but paying for it every two weeks? Really? This is just donation sucking at that point, which is NOT okay.. The game is fun, AT FIRST. It makes me think if it's rigged. I feel that it's designed to limit you progress. Like it senses if you haven't played that long yet and you're going way ahead of their intended progress, the level/stage will overwhelme you with monsters. I notice that whenever I reach a certain point, there will be more monsters than i can handle. Then after playing for a while, the same level will have lesser and more manageable monster. Overall, I don't recommend it.. OVER -10000 hitpoints ONE little red ball? It feels like the game forces you to watch adds (make you die if you don't -for example) I had a lot of fun with the game in the past, but it changed in a bad way. I play it almost an year now and the money feels like the priority now days. I used to pay for this sometimes, because I wanted to support you guys. Wish I could give it 5* for the fun I had, but it feels not right for what it is now.. At first the game was really good and fun but gets really annoying after some time. It just turns into endless grinding for items which have a really low drop rate and you get bored. I've been playing this game for well over a year and I'm yet to obtain a single gold item. Read that again, well over a year and still best I've got is perfect epic which took me a huge amount of time + buyin some small discounted items.. I use to love this game. It was still an extremely grindy game. I'm at the point where it costs me 110k to get another talent, and I STILL haven't unlocked the new progression system. They now killed the game for me. Its even harder to farm for the items you need with the new ones released. The free experience that was given was nerfed extremely hard. They could've made the game better with this patch but it was clearly a cash grab. Wouldn't recommend until the game gets fixed.. I wana give this game more stars. I wana rate it higher. I love this game. Me and my girlfriend compete to see who can get farther than the other. However. The equipment drop is pitiful at best. And the adaptive difficulty just isn't there. Each level gets more difficult, but it's to much. Given the gear, gem, coin drop it's almost forcing you to spend money. That's not how it used to be. I used to want to spend money on this.

All Rights Reserved.", "pos_reviews": "One of the best card games I've ever played, with such a simple (but unique) gimmick to it. Entertaining for hours, matches don't feel drawn out, fun gameplay, no forced microtransactions. Basically everything you could want in an online TCG. My only qualm, however, is that it doesn't feature Beavis and Butthead. Add them to the cast, and this game will be absolutely perfect.. I like it! It's very addictive! I know all the characters so it makes it more fun! Once you start playing the game it's hard to put it down! Ok! The game runs smooth, there's no slag! There are commercials, but, I was so busy playing the game, I really didn't notice them! All in all, it's a very cool game! Very easy to get into! This one's a keeper!. Through great updates A.D. has become an even better game. New auto play feature streamlines daily play. Lots of events, and matches mean there is always something to do. Combo system is simple to learn but robust and full of depth. Can be difficult at higher levels but with persistence can be mastered. Game is wonderful at restoring matches in progress if you lose signal. It does not simply issue a loss and take your resources if the game crashes. Much improved on a game that was already great!. Love this game. Only had it for a short while, but able to play constantly without much wait time. Great options if you don't want to spend any real money, and doesn't force in app purchases. Great graphics, runs smooth, very addicting. Lots of stuff going on, so it doesn't get boring. All in all, great game.. 2019:This game is great! Thanks to all those at Kongregate who make throwing down, with all my favorite toons, possible!! As far as game apps go, this one holds the record for staying on my phone! A little over two years. No other game has kept me interested enough to keep it longer that 6mths! Thanks again guys! Keep up the good work! Woot! Woot! 2022:Still happy as hell Kongregate!!!. GREAT GAME. Love the shows so I naturally love playing the game. Its the only game I've really spent money on. you dont need to spend it to play but it's a good enough game that I dont mind. It would be amazing if you guys can collaborate with the creators of Rick and Morty to bring a Rick and Morty based set to the game. that would take this game to a whole other level!!! Either way I'll keep playing the game for years to come!!!!. This game is AMAZING! I have great times playing and collecting cards. Although I'm not the best at the game it is still super enjoyable. I play nearly everyday and unlike other games the amount of ads you get are low, the only time you really get ads are when you watch them for rewards. This game is amazing and I'm not forgetting about it anytime soon.. Great game to play when you are on an unpredictable schedule, like waiting on the bus, or taking calls on a hotline. Playing this game, it allows the players to stop in the middle of a battle and take care of other things that needs doing, (like standing in line to get on the bus, or answering a call on that intermittently busy switchboard) without penalizing you for not putting the game first, over real life. You can take as much time as you want, and when you ready just tap the screen.. I would highly recommend This Game. It's basically everything you can ask for. The graphics are amazing in my opinion, it's based off pretty cool shows. And I mean just battling another Person you can really see the intense moment and the math and what cards you got a place Down. And out of all of that it's a really hilarious Game \ud83d\ude02 might as well have something to do that's fun during quarantine right?. From my experience, I haven't needed to throw any money at this game. I also play it while I watch Bob's Burgers, so watching ads for bonuses is enough for me to get by. There's a few times where I got my butt kicked, but you win some you lose some. I see people saying they need to throw money at this game, but that's not true. Throw on your favorite TV show, watch some ads, then play it for a few hours. Just like any other mobile game, if you play excessively you'll probably give in to paying.. Love this game! I already have a lot of legendary cards, without spending any money. Getting to the secret fight club takes alot of time, but it's worth as it pays off with super mythic stones. They need to add more ways to get EXP, not only Quests. Also please don't complain about The Simpsons not being there, they are copyrighted content... Be thankful that they got the rights to use 4 different popular TV shows.. Great game! Everytime I have to reset my phone, I get this game. I recommend this game if your tired of the same bubble pops and bingo games. It's challenging when you're trying to beat an opponent who has higher cards than you. You see the different cards mix and matched to make another card more powerful. It's awesome! August 2021 downloaded the game again on my new phone, still playing!. Honestly, one of the best games I have ever played!!! :) I won't lie, while it can be challenging at times the best part of this game is the nostalgia. This game has thousands of cards and variations all from everyone's favorite episodes!!! And so much to do that it's honestly difficult to juggle absolutely everything daily!!! Definitely try this game!!! :). This is THE best card game! well balanced and easy too play. Many thanks to the developers as they have made a great game that I will be enjoying for a long time I'm sure. The price of packs are ok but not needed. Once again a great game I would definitely recommend downloading it.. I've been playing ccg's for 25 years and I have to say that this game has the best mechanics of them all, gameplay wise at least(the combo system is a unique twist to the genre).Although this is somewhat a gacha game(as all ccgs are),in this one they give you good value for your investment. Spending isn't necessary though as they do give out good event rewards, but progress will be much slower if you don't pay the one time fee (i think its $5)to increase your research time for combos.. I've been playing this game for 2 years and havent gotten sick of it. My only request probably among others is adding one more show into the game, such as the Simpsons, Archer, just anything like those to give it some more flair. other than that, I reccomend to anyone willing to have a challenge and wanting some good wholesome fun.. Awesome game! Funny moments from the shows, easy to learn, and more depth than first appears. Don't have to pay to play. There are plenty of things you can buy, but there is ads to not have to. They aren't annoying though, and you choose when to watch them for stuff in the game. I don't like forced ads and pay to play games. It's a good example of how games can give you pay options, but keep a game ad supported, in a fun way! If you like the shows, check it out. You'll be glad you did. This is an awesome game and I loved playing this game but somehow had lost my account and all my progress. I mailed the developers regarding this, honestly I didn't much hope but the developers were very friendly and kept mailing back asking for information and finally found out my account. I haven't seen this level of dedication ever in a game, the people involved in making this game are as awesome as the game.. Fun. I enjoy deck builders, and this is no different. I will warn that it can be tempting to spend money, but pretty easy not to and still have fun. I did have the game shut down on me at one point, but it let me jump right back in and resume my fight (I believe it was a pvp, still learning what's what). Ease of use, favorite shows, lots of fun!. I just thought this looks cute so I gave it a try. I love this game's take on combos and effects/skills. There are 2 major types of cards, a character and an object. These 2 can be mixed and matched to make a new card. There are different modes of play, PvE, PvP, a guild rumble and some events. All in all, there's no story but as with most card games, it's mostly about strategy and building a deck that suits your style. I'm really enjoying it!", "neg_reviews": "After playing everyday for 8 months, spending more money than I would like to say, its disheartening when you realize that unless you spend tens of thousands of dollars, you will NEVER be close to the top 10% of players. Zero skill involved, they ratchet up the difficulty the more you spend/the better you get. The cheating the A.I. does at times is laughable and utterly frustrating. No one to blame but myself, I did know getting into it that it was pay to play. Caveat Emptor!. Lame PayToWin game. Not worth spending time/money. Even the whales that spend 10's of thousands $ still lose just lose to hackers. Primary problem:GAME IS BORING. When you are \"playing\" against other players you are playing against an Ai piloting their deck. There is almost zero strategy involved in deck building & playing, just spend more time/money get better cards. They are so aware of how boring and unskilled, you can just press a button and the AI will instantly play entire game.. man has my opinion changed as i prgoressed thru this game. first of feels everyone is a bot when i look at the high scores because unkess they are buying beer bottles i cant even get a single beer bottle of a dam crate. second i cant go on a two winning streak when the game decides to throw such crazy last minute combos, or myrhics that im like wow this bot has four perfect mythic cards? this game went from being a fun game to well a game where now im lucky to log in and collect my reward SMH. Definitely pay to win. after you reach a certain point the damage curve is too high. youll reach a point where you can no longer beat the people who drop hundreds of dollars on the game and the story missions cannot be beat without you yourself spending hundreds lf dollars on the game. nothing more than a joyless cash grab.. Tried to get back into the game but they changed how their IAP boxes work, and not for the better. Guess I'm gone for good.. i really loved playing the game. lots of fun and excitment when it was working. i joined a great guild and enjoyed the rumbles. built up a pretty good deck. but then i couldnt get back into the game. i would wait while it loaded, got to the first menu, then the current ad would pop up and when i tapped close the ad the whole game went black then back to my desktop. over and over and over again. i just wanted to thank everyone in the guild for all their help and teamwork. i will miss it.. My biggest complaint is that each game is calculated in the beginning if you will win or not. I know that sounds crazy but as soon as you win 4 in a row the CPU starts with epic cards and all your good cards are non existent. this happens EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very disappointing because I actually really liked this game. the pvp isnt real you are actually playing the CPU. I feel like this game was just a giant scam.. I have been playing this game since the beginning and at first it was great however they realized that they needed to appeal to the losers who dont want to invest the time but the money (which is more important to them obviously). So now it has turned to a pay to win I play everyday and do all the challenges and yet my deck gets worse than the average. So F this game and the makers they are complete scumbags. Terrible card game. Essentially nothing but spamming a manaless creatures every turn then throwing a manaless equip card on top. No real strategy just hope you get better cards then your opponent. References are the only high point, the game play is terrible.. Okay so the premise of this game is great and visually it looks amazing. They've managed to bring together the various shows brilliantly...BUT the game itself is actually quite poorly designed at the moment. 2 weeks in and I've already seen big problems. Examples: The card you put down can only attack the card in front of it, no others; there's WAY too many currencies within the game and most of them are pointless; you can't play other people in real time!! There's more but I can't fit it in.. I just lost all my researched combonations including the ones that come with the cards. was a fun game but not worth getting invested and loosing all your advancement randomly. also no FAQ or contact for help that i can find without a hassle.. It was fun at first, but now years into playing this game I have yet to get a mythic, once I reached rank 15 I lose 9/10 arena battles, the secret fightclub events are IMPOSSIBLE, I dont care what you say. I feel like I have something wrong with my brain for even spending a dollar on this crappy lootbox game, go ahead take a look at how much Ive spent! I should be able to win no problem but nope. money is what this game is about, I remember now why I quit the first time. Entertaining game with one major flaw- the card combination system. Combining cards isn't the problem- it's the researching every combo that really sticks in the mud. If you play every day, it would take more than 2 years just to research all the combinations. That's far too much of a commitment to make for most players, including myself... The 8 hour time should be reduced to at least 1 hour and the 24 hour reduced to 4 hours. I don't appreciate generic replies, so please don't reply at all.. Love the game, why don't you let me play! Energy regen is rediculously slow and I can't even watch an advert to get any energy. Why? Yeah I can buy $5 worth of gems to extend play time by like 10 minutes.. Pros: game quality, animations, incentives to play to improve cards and characters, fun, it's all here! Very easy to figure out, excellent UI, very high quality! Cons: I see large value in the game and it's a lot of fun. I want to be able to buy it to remove ads and energy timers. Charge a high one time fee. I want to play it more than every 5-10 minutes, only to wait hours to play another 5-10 minutes. Yes there is a gem system to recharge, but it is horrendously expensive. I will not pay it. is pay to win. Unless you plan on paying $ daily , will have to play for a very long time to get a good card. (update) got worse, now Have to watch adds to get better. and there adds screw up All the time, forcing you to restart 3 time a play. They also keep adding events that do not work. Right now is swole club, all milestones in it freezing. I am lowering to 1 star.. Fun game, but since i made a small purchase in game, the frequency of getting ad crates has gone noticably down. Which means my fuel refill potential has gone way down so I can't enjoy the game as much as i was before i made the purchase. So once you spend money on the game the devs make it harder to play the game, apparently, so you have to spend more money on it. This is really dirty. Plus making a purchase didn't even refill the energy. Very dumb.. it's fun at first, but then slows down like hitting a brick wall. For me the game is practically impossible right now. There's a level that is getting the buff in it's stats right now making an already hard opponent now impossible to beat. Since he's not beatable I can't progress and therefore not fun to play and have now stopped. concepts there application isn't.. The game used to be good when the ads were 15 seconds. Now we get 3 part ads that force u to watch 3 ads, then it freezes your screen forcing you yo restart while giving no reward. I've complained about these broken ads several times and got told to pay $10 a month to go ad free. So the game doesn't work properly and i have to pay for a fix? Guess they don't want players coming back. 90% of the game time is now spent restarting my phone just to give up since i have to play without my ad boost.. The game itself has a really great concept, however, the developers and the administrative staff make the game unpleasant. There are way too many combinations and cards to collect, and you will never be able to collect them all or upgrade them all due to how they dispense new cards. Unless you would like to continue to dump money into the game it becomes hard to win, making the game less about skill and more about how much you are willing to pay.", "pos": "Negative Reviews Summary:\n- Some users wish the game featured Beavis and Butthead, The Simpsons, Archer, or Rick and Morty for more variety.\n- A few players mentioned that the game can be difficult at higher levels, requiring persistence to master.\n- One user expressed a desire for more ways to earn experience points beyond quests.\n- There were minor complaints about occasional game crashes, but overall positive sentiments regarding the game's ability to restore matches.\n- A player mentioned losing their account but praised the developers for their dedication in helping retrieve it.\n- Some players found the game tempting for in-app purchases but managed to have fun without spending money.\n- An individual highlighted the lack of a storyline in the game, which is typical for card games focused on", "neg": "Negative reviews mainly focus on the following key issues:\n\n1. **Pay-to-win:** Users express frustration with the game's pay-to-win mechanics, where spending significant amounts of money is necessary to progress or compete with top players.

Once I catch on how to maneuver within this app just maybe I'll be able to say it's a good one. One thing I can say is there's too many changes all at one time. Instructions are not always comprehendable. Some of us need \" Google Go for Dummies\"... Deleting browsing activity/history is still confusing to me..

It is very nice how you do not have to download two apps to get lite versions of the whistle your need. It is an all in one app, ready for use I'm ready for improvement. for me it is very good I don't think it needs much. Best App For Searching Anything!!

Just In Love With The App \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d.. My favorite app. Reading out loud webpages, fast results both in images and web search, lite pages, light browser, eye candy, light voice search, favourite apps and suggestions, history, predictions, live widget with charts, discover, weather. All these features are basically essentials of present. Widget is so well implemented that it should be inculcated into google app.. I absolutely love this. I'm glad I gave it a go, considering I already have Google regular app. But, Google is notorious for redundant apps, so I hope they drop the other one and keep this one because it is GREAT. Great UI, great results, and it's actually very fast. I don't know how they made it so much faster, but it's the first thing I noticed.. I really like this application.Useful for research and entertainment.One of my favorite points is this app can be read in all languages.But, I'm Cambodian, the language I understand best is Khmer, I like English readers voice really nice,But even in Khmer voice, it can be scary sometime, and sometime it's funny .Anyway thank you..

I absolutely love this app...literally, the easiest, most informative, burden-free browser available today. I'm nobody's dummy, but I will admit, today's technology can be overwhelming and yes, occasionally make you feel dumb. Google Go, has not only made it easy comfortable for me to learn as I go. The Simplicity and availability it offers for daily routines, and resourceful information, can leave one feeling confident and knowledgeable.. First of all, the ui is pretty ideal. Beautiful and clean. Secondly, compared to the usual Google browser, I can see downloaded images. However, the only thing I'm not finding so cool about it is you can't create tabs. That's pretty bad for such amazing browser. Thanks for the wallpaper feature too. You deserve 5 stars.. This app is really good. I think it deserves 5 stars but I have an issue. It is a bit different from Google, not just talking about its visuals. When I want to open a site from photos, it doesn't have a option. When we click on people also search for, we start getting more similar questions but it doesn't provide that. But since I needed it, I tried to install Google but it always says I can't because I have a similar app. I need you to do something about it. Beside that, it is totally awesome!. It is the best for searching and browsing but it uses it's own browser which is not very fast so it is better it open an external browser like chrome for browsing and please ad ok google voice search feature in Google Go. Yes! Google has made some improvements ! There are some Google apps I didn't use at all because they either were 1. unnecessary, 2. Or Actually more inconvenient then convenient . However I've made time to recheck Google and saw they made an update! With this I actually will use the Google Assistant once it's set up. If it's easier I'm game, and this definitely is !.

Lighter than what? The Play description says it's similar to Google. Google what? Maps? News? Search? WHAT? And... why are there a big bunch of videos on how to use it? I guess they want you to take a semester of Google Go class to know how to use something that should be simple and intuitive to begin with. And to add to Google's confusion is the complete lack of human help. It's not very comforting when the email listed here (and other Google apps) for developer contact isn't valid. Google has literally taken away any form of communication. As for this app, it's nothing but a cluster of confusion that certainly doesn't make my life easier. Why did Google waste their time on this confusing mess? Do they think I want to waste my day on learning a new way to get lost? ZERO STARS for another Google half baked attempt.. Does not respect my google account settings. The temperature indicator in the upper left-hand corner displays the wrong units, the voice of assistant doesn't match the assistant app, I gave her an Aussie accent, but in google go she's American... etc and there are no setting to change this behaviour. Also if you have it installed you can't install the regular google app yet it came with my phone and thus is non-deletable... not cool. I'm very unhappy.. It's tearing up my iPad. It causes screen blackouts, sends everything to the popdown box to be searched for later. I have problems getting to the internet. Google offices won't answer my email about problems with Gmail, and other problems with Google and chrome. I'm wanting to replace with other apps. I don't know which ones...need to replace browser and search engine. It pops up with a blue light mode constantly...this is a big problems. Blue light freezes screen.... Android Go is a big waist of space, literally. And Google Go apps is like driving a Lamborghini with no body, wheels, engine, or a steering wheel. No options, everything is the bare minimum, and the worst searching experience ever, id rather use the search from Win95. its apps and Android Go that let phone manufacturers make a cheap phone thats pretty much usless.. I absolutely HATE this app, it came with my tablet or I would of uninstall the first day!! Everytime I search something google lite has to pop in and I HAVE to click on it because there is NO option not too and so it completely screws my search up and I have to start all over again. Whoever dreamed this up needs to be fired immediately. I have NEVER seen such an irritating app EVER!!! Believe me when I say \" I'll never buy another tablet/phone if this app is on it\" UPDATE: still the worst app. No where near as good as google chrome, This app isnt a stand-alone type browser. I thought it was so i downloaded it, of course everyone wants a lighter app i like how you can change the background but no incognito mode , no desktop mode ,no tabs, also cant say what news i dont want to see unlike in the other version of this app you can say \"not interested in this topic \" so forced to see things i don't want to. Wasted my time \"deleting\" google chrome for this, this is actually more work to use. In the beginning when the app was introduced it worked great. Every time it upgrades now the saving images from the web does not work. It keeps on giving me ' sorry something went wrong' message. Annoying as it is, it does not get resolved either. Upgrading or reinstalling does not seem to help the problem. \ud83d\ude14. Why the pictures are not showing up on google go no more? Only the websites can be seen..the main feature which I needed after getting this app, is gone now. Previously, when I searched out any topic or searched for its images, it appeared at the top of the screen very fast..but now, it only provides me lots of websites which are of no use. So google, please look into my problem and try to solve it..please, its my earnest request..I really need this to be solved.. When I pressed search, it keeps on opening an app that is not a browser on my phone, I deleted it, I'll wait for a few more days until the developer fixes the bugs... It's ridiculous to download this Go app if it has been designed not to substitute the old one, if not to coexist, to run parallel to the standard version?!!! So, what is this for, if it cannot work alone, instead the old one because is so small it can't run as the old one does, meaning: is not functional. Come on,get serious! The good thing is that is good, works fine, nice UI, so, again, what for? I could give more stars, but what for? Only opens one tab at the time?! Nice app, but uninstalled. I just use this app and i really find an issue that if i want to play a movie to watch then the browser does not gives me option to #PlayOnline it just gives me the #download option?. It is convenient and easy to \"get into search mode\" . There are a few things that irks me. 1) the \"downloading sounds\", there seems to be no way to turn it off. (If anyone has found it please to tell me) 2) a \"your lite page is ready\" dialogue box pops up while a page is being loaded there seems to be no way to close it. 3) Can't select \"downloads\" folder. Goes to system default. Irksome, when you have to go hunt for it and that you want the file inside a secondary storage.. It should be 5 stars but,when I tried to browse something by clicking on the relevant site,It says Google Go isn't responding...But other features are soo cool.Please fix my problem as soon as possible.... Interesting. I was wondering for the last THREE WEEKS why my regular voice search app from Google AND the microphone button on my smartphone wasn't recording what I was saying. I am certain that it was due to Google's promotion of Google Go. This is all well and good, however, perhaps it might be best to give us an alert that Google is discontinuing an app before I had to go and clear the data for A LOT of apps and the hours I wasted. That would be the prudent thing to do, wouldn't you agree?. All of the Go, or Lite apps suck big time. What a waste of space and time. Can't delete them either because they are pre- installed \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20... No OK Google, and the Google assistant really sucks. WHY...???\ud83d\ude2b It says faster, really, it never gives me any information at all. Again what a waste. When I need info I use another device that has real Google.. This app is good until it lags so much that it becomes unconsciously unstable sometimes.Otherwise,it works well..but a few thing which will really increase the app rating is that...this app must have good camera scan or taking picture of anything and giving suggestion according to it...the feature whicha ctually google has...but google go only has translate, it's okay but glad if u add the picture to anything search camera.Hope my request will be fulfilled...Thanks. Just uninstalled it after two days of sincerely attempting in vain to comprehend how it had improved upon the original Google app. The moment at which this opens one is faced with a violation of esthetics, a mass of confusion, and a lack of order. In an effort to display a plethora of source possibilities and choices, simplicity has been obliterated. When I reinstalled the original format, there was an audible sigh of relief.. This app is good until it lags so much that it becomes unconsciously unstable sometimes.Otherwise,it works well..but a few thing which will really increase the app rating is that...this app must have good camera scan or taking picture of anything and giving suggestion according to it...the feature whicha ctually google has...but google go only has translate, it's okay but glad if u add the picture to anything search camera.Hope my request will be fulfilled...Thanks", "pos": "Users love Google Go for its **speed and data efficiency**, particularly praising the **\"lite\" browsing mode** and **fast search results** even on slow connections.

I'm a really big fan of cookie and am addicted to this game. I recommend it for anyone who just loves cute things. if anyone is reading this I am really reccomending this game because it's just to to fun and when I started playing I just couldn't put my phone down! if anyone dislikes this game there's no reason to be so hateful cos its rude!. OMG I LOVE IT SO MUCH! Its soooo cute, I should of picked the cookie but I like popcorn so I picked Popper, Cookie if your reading this, Thank you for making this app, I love it SO much, it's so cute, there is A Mall, Hospital, Pizzeria, Factory, Bakery, Arcade, This is AMAZING, Thank you for making this game again, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Goodbye! Have a nice day! :3. I loved your adopt me vids but this game is even BETTER! love the first house and the arecade but the only thing that is kinda anoying is the items are kinda expensive but every thing is worth it! I loved the games and the pets i love this app plz add some new features one day like a peperment PET and some new arecade games!!!!!!!!!!!! Love all your other videos and channel!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the perfect game to play when im board plz add more games to play and have fun i liked and subscribe. This game was soooooo fun!\ud83d\ude0d I love the cute pets you can get and this would be a good game for people who love Cookie swirl c. The other thing I like about this is to me it's nice to play this when something sad is on your mind. The only thing harsh I have to say is that I would lovvvvve it if I could make my own character I hope this information helped.\ud83d\ude0a. My 5 year old and I both love playing this game so much!! Its exciting to see the new pets available each day. They are so sooooo adorable!! Ive never had any issues and I think this is a great game to play for any age. The only issue we could possibly have would be, as cookie swirl C fans, there isnt any cookie swirl C content really. But we still love it. Thanks!!. I love cookieswirlc and she has been my favorite YouTuber since I was four, and was my first YouTuber. For me, the only small bug is that I think they're should be a way to buy coins, and also for me, buying gems doesn't work. I click on it but it doesn't bring me to a buying page. I restarted my phone, shut it on and off but it still won't work. (\u15d2\u15e9\u15d5)But really overall, I love this game so much and the pets are so cute!! It makes me feel like I'm with cookie. Thank you so muchhh \ud83c\udf6a\u2665\ufe0f. My sister loves it game when ever she gets my phone she starts playing it, my brother and sisters both love the game, but it is kinda annoying that you only get a certain amount of tickets, my sister's and brother are sad that they can't have fun with ur game all day so I think u should not have tickets and just let them play. Who else agrees with me! =^_^=. I love this app because you earn coins and some other stuff by playing games and the games are so fun.You can go to the arcade, Hospital and the bakery in some more places and they are so much fun and you even get to take care of a little pets you can go to the market and buy some stuff for your pets you can also buy more pets at the market.. Such a cute pet \ud83d\ude0d love how they have created the eyes so big and cute you can do not much but it's worth the love that your pet gives you if you put it in a separate room then it walks over to you and comes near to the screen and I chose the one which is the cutest of all pets cookie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't know why some people gave it 1 star it is worth it 5 stars from me.... I LOVE COOKIESWIRLC SO I LOVE THE APP! There's so much to do and lots of animals to collect! The animals are also interactive, so thats amazing. None of the things are challenging, and there's not a lot of ads! It's an amazing app!!!! Theres even ways to get to her channel and Instagram and stuff!. Well i got this for my sister Emmy who is a really big fan of cookie swirl c. Today she forced me to play it and i ended up playing it more then her and i am 12. This game is amazing! My sister loves it. I love it. There is nothing bad about it. keep up the good work!\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c. I think this game is great! it's fun, addicting, and yet repetative in such a fun way. I noticed in the the house stuff would sparkle when you could click it for a few coins, and I think you should do the same for the city to make it seem a bit more lively! just an update idea I had in mind. =) but other than that, great game, and even fun for a 12 year old like me.. it was GREAT i love cookie swirl c shes my fav. youtuber and the app is great ive been watching cookie sense i dont even rember and im 8 now the app is so detaled and sure lots of buildings are on construshion (sorry if miss spelled)what ever! have you ever seen a FINNISHED building with decorashons but it is all closed? nope! and Booooo to the haters of cookie and/or her game!. It is an amazing app here are some things that would be really awesome in this app:items to decorate your house,customize your house,send presents to other players,become friends with other players,change your pet's name,when you adopt a pet you can change their gender,it shows their traits when you adopt one,and if you could add an legandary pet that would be really cool here's an example-rose gold cookie or an diamond donut pet! if you could add a rare one too like a golden lolly pet!. I love to watch cookie swirl c videos and in one video it told to download the game I did it but when I did not have any tickets so I watched 3 ads but still I had 0 tickets though I needed to have 30 please try to fix this problem and make more games like this thanks \ud83d\ude0a. Can you make pets cost less. And could you make like a wilderness so you can catch the pets except from buying them oh yeah it came inside the pets cost less and can you finish some of those places that are under construction. Here are three ideas. One you can make the fountain that's under construction a.park. and the second one is that you could make that race track under construction.a. race track. Can make everything that's under construction anything. This game is so fun and adicting cookie if you are reading this I'm your #1 super fan the only thing I would change would be that we actuly got tickets when we watch the adds but other then that I love this game soooooooooo much please make more games just like this cute app. It is the best game we should be thankful to Cookie Swirl C or the creator because when you play this game you can buy pets,clothes,accesories for pets,toys and food. Im so thankful for the creator because they made a fun game for kids and they will love this game. Thank you. I love this game so much! Even CookieSwirlC! I love the games in the arcade & everything! I give this 5 Stars! Because I really love it! I can't wait for a update or something! And this pretty cute! The pets are cute like everything is pretty cute! Controls: 5 Graphics: 5 Gameplay: 5 Everything just 5 stars! I recommend getting this app! \ud83d\ude04. i love this game!!!! omg my pet is popper i love him/her!!! there are no errors in this games! And i just got this a like a few minutes and i love it all ready so i give this game 5 stars!!!", "neg_reviews": "bad, my 4yr old love cookie swirl c youtube but this game is horrible with ads and the ticket thing and time limit is so hard for my little one. she used all her ticket in 10min and now every time she has to watch an ad just to get more or wait 30min to play a new game. not even one game free when you run out of tickets.\ud83d\ude14 uninstalling waist of our time.. fun mini games until the inappropriate ads started popping up, despite my daughters account having enough tickets to play without ads. plus the ads went from 15-30seconds to 30-60 seconds! not worth the negative exposure of adult themed ad popups.. ok this was down loaded for my 5 year old to play I actually liked it because it doesn't allow them to play for too long before there tickets run out. HOWEVER the ads are completely inappropriate!! advertising a colouring app called Annabell with pictures of blood covered dolls!! WTAF!! not good and my child will not be allow on it again! sort it out!. cookie swirl world is acting up for me i don't know what's wrong with it, so untill you fix it im giving it a one star. Great app idea, but... please do an update to earn tickets. The function to watch a video to earn tickets is not working! Also, every time you click \"Play Again\" on the games, it subtracts 2 tickets but doesn't relaunch the game, so you have to spend additional tickets to re-play a game! Also, it sounds like the areas \"Under Construction\" haven't been worked on or updated for 2 years! At this rate, unless a major update is done, no one will invest in this app!. My 4 year old loves this game, she loves cookie, but I can't let her play because she keeps getting perverted game adds about men and women playing stripping games, and fetish stuff. Please fix this so my daughter can play again. If it's a family friendly game, then there shouldn't be adult adds.. Not E for everyone, my 4 yr old kept having to see short skirted girls smacking each other. It was on their bottoms not their face but still really bad. Even had devil horns on their heads!! Dont understand why they would do this. She was looped into some other Bad app but can't call it e for everyone if it keeps looping you into bad app and its really hard not to see the dumb one. Don't want my girl to think thats what she is supposed to do.. I can't see other players in cooking swirl world and everything is for tickets almost every thing but it is a very cool game and why did you share the game on app store if there are places that are under construction and the to do list is coming soon. but I still think it's a cool game thank you. and I mean it boring ?????. guys this is a good game but I don't think so that the some places are locked and my friend is my friend has also installed this game and she is also saying that some places are really locked and we are getting bored with game and with me and my friend is also saying that we are bored with this came there is nothing to play the only some some games and I am also seriously saying this that if you are installing this games please not give it any star and giving with only but I am really bored. It's an amazing app, but the annoying thing is that you need to use tickets to play the games.They give you 10 and you have to use like, 3 or 2 tickets to play the games and it's really annoying, but overall the game is really fun.. Having a kids game that takes tickets to play the games inside is not a great set-up. My daughter gets frustrated. One game takes 3 tickets so you run out quickly, then you have to watch another ad just to get tickets again. Very poorly made game for kids.. Love the game but pls make an uodate whith new pets that cost less and all of the pets cost the same price and a place to find tge same kind of pets from the store so we csn save some of our coins and new places and even better whith multi-player if you can do all of these thank you so much. I think that they really could have done better so thats why I rated it two star because I only ten tickets and it was not and I mean not fun.So I recommend that no one gets this game!!. Everytime my child leaves the game. Weather its for a day or jist 5 min. Her pet is 0s for happy energy food etc..\ud83d\ude44 not impressed as she's not spending money to purchase things and would half to. We agreed to delete the game and find somthing else. On another note it just started doing this not sure if it was a glitch. But very cute game that she enjoyed. I was very disappointed with this app I thought it would be way more cooler and fun than it was and I thought the pets would be actual pets I thought there'd be lots to do I love Cookie Swirl I watch all the time when you too but she needs to do a better job on her app I would not recommend this app to \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b. I hated it I think she should quit YouTube she's annoying stop please. I put this game on my son's tablet because he is obsessed with cookie swirl c. But this game is awful. You can barely play, each game you only get 60 seconds to play and then you have to spend more tickets. Tickets also take forever to get. Why make a game if you don't actually want people to be able to play it??? Also, not really a huge issue but it is annoying, the game is littered with spelling and grammatical errors. There are plenty more issues to list but I only get 500 characters to type.. tells you to earn tickets by watching videos, but won't give you the tickets earned. very frustrating.. I wish this game was better. I would give it a zero star if i could. (No offense,cookie \ud83d\ude23) its so hard to just press a button and its driving me CRAZY its SO annoying!!\ud83d\ude20im deleting this app!! Can you pLSSS fix this bug???. No way to exit game.

This app can be a little ridiculous sometimes because I've collected a lot of coins in the past one day they decided to cut my coins and half or less and now I've been collecting them anyways and I went to get my whole 13 Coins after 7 days and the screen flashed and all the sudden took me back to seven full days so I wasn't able to collect my weekly 13 whole coins instead of three.

They have so much to choose from. If your shopping for a quality non-authentic item it's worth it! A fraction of the price of the real deal! Read the seller reviews and look at the review pictures. Like buying any place on line, you have to research. Dont expect to pay $20 for something that costs $1,500, and get grade A quality. But DO pay $100-$200 for the better quality items. Considering where they are shipping from, it didnt take long, was actually faster then I expected.. Find good sellers and the app is well worth it! Look at seller photos and reviews. Recommend the sellers with over 98% and at least 1-2 years. Also look at transaction count. I go with high transaction count sellers. Shipping time is different with each seller and can be inaccurate at times. It is just a chance you have to take. App makes it very convenient. Youtube videos can teach you about dhg. Good luck guys!. First Time Users. I love it. Easy to look for what I want. In fact, I can browse on this app all day shopping. Just done my first purchase and there is also a message box to message the seller too. Very easy to communicate about my order. Can't wait to receive my order and see the quality of my items. Looking forward for great, easy, and fun business. If I can. ;))). Refunds system fknshte, app tells you you have to upload photographic evidence, yet when you click on the camera icon to do the upload there is no response. You contact Customer Service, and after telling Artificial Intelligence to get lost anywhere between 13 and 35 times you get a real Customer Service Agent who tells you to come back and try again in 24 hours. Nonsense. Was just given a link to Customer Service -doesn't work.. I always find great goodies!!! They have everything you can imagine. Things for the whole family and things that look expensive, without you actually breaking the bank. Plus they are big supporters of wholesale merchandise. You can start any type of store shopping with DHgate. Best shopping app out here. The only downside is since the things come from overseas, u may have to wait up to 30 days to receive them but good things are worth waiting on!!. Never had an issue using this app, but I have only ever brought clothing (i.e., shirts, jerseys, etc.) Delivery is usually early, but as most of what I order comes from Asia, it can take up to a month. Most sellers are polite and easy to communicate with (in my experience), and will even send photos of products before purchasing to allow you to see what exactly you'll be buying. To be honest, as long as this App sells what I'm looking to buy, I'm always gonna use it!. Great app, great products. Highly satisfied with quality and price. I have purchased shoes and sport jerseys. Everything is on point!!! Takes about three to four weeks to receive items. But its definitely worth the wait. Sometimes you luck out and receive item faster than expected.. This app is absolutely amazing, you can find anything you want. Even big brands like oakley, nike, Adidas, and so much more at a reasonable price or at a ridiculously low price! This app is so worth it. It's like they've rigged the system or something on prices and still somehow make money! Thank you for this app!!. I personally think this app is great. I never had a problem. If you listen to the advice of the creator or creators you should have a great experience as well. Read the info that they supply on Reddit(thats how I started)they point you to top and more importantly trusted sellers. Fortunately for me I can't speak on problems. I haven't had one. Once you find your trusted sellers save them and stick with them. I ask for business cards, and talk over Whatsapp or Messenger etc.. I personally think this app is great. I never had a problem.

I've now ordered 5 items from DHgate Online. My son turned me on to it. The overall selection and ongoing communication of the tracking and order status is first class. I did have an issue with one of my orders, but to DHgate credit, they communicated perfectly to resolve the small issue. I can honestly say that I would recommend this site over any domestic online sites available. The savings? Is amazing!! You're not paying the outlandish mark up charges for the very same stuff offered here \u2764. I love DHgate!\u2661I've placed 5 orders up til now and obviously there's a wait to get your items with them coming from abroad, but the 1st item I bought only took 19 days to arrive so it wasn't as long as I expected it to be at all \ud83d\ude42 The communication barrier is a bit of an issue with some sellers obviously not being able to speak the same language, but the app is easy to use so you can email questions etc if need be. Some of the items are real bargains! I recommend and would use again 100% \ud83d\ude09 xx. App is very user friendly. You can find a lot of high quality items if you know where to look. Shipping is cheap and slow sincr all packages go thru several custom agencies. Don't expect to receive your products within a week of placing the order. It just won't happend unless you want to pay way extra and make arrangements directly with the store.. The app is great. I ordered a guitar and i got a beautiful piece of art. I own a les paul, a gretsch and a strat. But this dh gates guitar is my best one. It deserves 20 stars. Everything went smoothly. No problems with payment. And customer service above and beyond. 20 stars all the way around. 2 months later and im still very impressed with my guitar. Its the best guitar i own. Right now im saving up for another one and i know who to get it from. DH Gates.. This app is great if your trying to save a few bucks but you have to be smart about what you purchase, just because someone has something shinny and and it looks like gold, doesn't make it gold!! I have yet to have a negative transaction in 3 years, I always get what I paid for and it's always as described. I've gotten everything from knives to car parts and shoes, even some stuff for gaming. Do your research and I bet your experience will be a positive one!!. This site is legit! The quality of the sports jerseys (I've ordered 3 already) are simply perfection! I would recommend ANYONE to use this site. I just ordered a huge tool kit and can't wait to get it. The only negative (and its not even negative really) is the 3 week delivery time. Other than that, I love love love love this site!. Both times I ordered something, I had very good service. However, BUYER BEWARE!! You MUST look at the \"stores rating\" before buying from them. I would not recommend buying anything from a store that has lower than a 90% satisfactory rating. Also DO NOT buy from a store that is new or has very few transactions. Not everyone is honest and from what I've found if you do your due diligence and look at the ratings, you will have a good experience and the product will be what you see advertised. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "neg_reviews": "The absolute worst shopping experience I have ever had. They do NOT protect the buyer, the items are NOT standard US sizes, the items do NOT show up as described/puctured, the items are NOT shipped when they claim and when you are unsatisfied and open a dispute (per their regulations), they try to guilt you into closing it. When you request a refund, they want you to return the item first, then pending receipt of the item, they want to refund store credit. No thanks. Never again.. It's a scam. You get given fake tracking numbers and your items get booked in and out of the same building abroad until the time lapses and they release your money to them. Even the \"developer\" that seems concerned on here and leaves a link as you can clearly see leaves a \"404 doesnt exist\"link. If you want honest reviews click their address (in chinese) and you'll see thousands of complaints. You need to AVOID THESE SCAM ARTISTS LIKE THE ABSOLUTE PLAUGUE. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK DH GATE!!!!. This is my first order and it is becoming a bad experience. Ordered for a product and the same very day got a message from supplier that prices gave gone up and should send money money. Later supplier claimed the order was shipped and sent a tracking number. Only to be informed that wrong address was used. I was later told that they will source another supplier for me. Now the story is back to wrong address. I can't even open a dispute until 13-11-2021 for refund of my money. Terrible. I've had plenty of good experiences with purchases on this app. However, it can be a long overdrawn process to get your money back when not receiving your items. Usually it would give the seller a 3 month time frame to have your order delivered. Now they've added even more days to that so it could take well over 100 days from time of purchase to receive a refund. This would be a great app if they would jus fix the freaking bugs! Every minute or two the screen automatically refreshes itself so whatever your looking at is lost and you have to go and search for it all over again!! It's so frustrating that I hardly ever use it anymore!! I see others also complaining about the same problem!! Please fix this immediately!. The bug is fixed and the app no longer randomly closes. But since then I ran into an issue with a seller not sending out my package that I had bought way before this covid 19 situation and dh gate has done nothing to resolve the issue. I'm finding that they don't really seem to care about the customer. They are seriously one of the worst companies to work with when it comes to getting a refund back.. Great app. Easy to find, sort, and filter. Unfortunately, All three of my orders were shipped to the wrong address in three different cities in the U.S. The delay this causes is very disconcerting. Shipping is bad enough without the delay a wrong address causes. Customer service is largely automated and it is difficult to talk about a problem that's not in their pick list. If I ever have a successful delivery, I will revisit this review. As it stands now though, they are definitely the worst.. The app does not crash anymore after an update about 9 months ago, but the latest update does not fully display the specifications of the item anymore (window does not scroll down). They really need some better QC on their application. Please fix the scrolling issue, it has gotten worse with the last update. It also appears the site has gotten much slower.. Be careful what you buy and from who some sellers are great some are misleading, my son though he was buying a toy pistol and it was described as such ,but in fact I to was just a picture of 1, I picked up on the the small print and tried to cancel the order within a hour of him ordering it, the seller ignored the request and sent it anyway, so far I can't find a way to talk to a actual person from customer care ,just AI help desk , I'm really disappointed in the customer care. Be warned .. I placed an order on dress from the Cinder01 store, and I was told the item got missing before getting to me, and applying for a refund had been so impossible. Didn't enjoy my first experience at all\ud83d\ude25.. I keep contacting dhgate customer service \ud83d\ude12 they do not help .I'm not sure why they are working if they do not help. Michael,Darrell and Cyrus who i have talked to several times. I get a error code now I do not .my points are 11794 but shows on my account 7094. Every time I talk with them I lose points. I have spent a 1000 dollars this week. I spend alot every week. And my account is being tampered with. i am reporting this to headquarters i have screen shots also.. Marketplace is fine, but the bugs make it unusable to me. While browsing the app, it randomly turns the screen white and reloads the homepage or the search results (kind of auto refreshing or something). I tried to report the bug in the app but the app reloaded the page and my text was gone so I have to do it here. I'm on a Note 8. This can happen at any time, randomly. This also means that when I choose a product and it throws me back to the homepage, is that I have to redo the search. App seems very untrustworthy and \"payment verification\" doesn't seem secure. And the worst part is there is never any time to have direct contact with someone from the company. When sending feedback, you never really hear anything back or get a thank you anything for the feedback. I will changing the cards used in this app because it all seems like a scam. Sorry to the sellers there. The reason I decided to rate this app a 1/5 stars is because the last week and a half I have been unable to even open the app. What I mean by this is, I try to open the app and every time dhgate will open for a split second and then I will get a notification saying \" there has been a problem opening the app\" and then asking me if I'd like to close the app, go to app info and to send feedback. I have sent feedback a few times and uninstalled and reinstalled the app so many times. I need help !. Good prices when you ACTUALLY GET.....IF YOU GET what you ordered. Trying to resolve issues is difficult, especially for the buyer. More than 5 times, I never got my order OR a refund. So BE CAREFUL. Expect the money you spend to be lost. But, when it works it's good. Clothes run RIDICULOUSLY small. And even a 3x, probably won't fit. BE CAREFUL. You will not get any help returning or complaining bad items. Once your money is spent, it's gone. Expect that.. The app is good and decent but the only stupid thing about it is when you have a bunch of items in your cart it automatically selects all so if you hit delete one item by mistake they're all checked and you will empty your entire card out and have to search for the same things all over again. NEW INFO 2/2020-this app needs to be fixed it continuously restarts when I am looking at an item and just goes back to the cart or to the item page. I have to search all over again and look for the same. Opened a dispute with a seller due to an incorrect size of item being sent. Unable to send messages through the DHgate app. Looks like I am going to lose my \u00a343 on this item, as DHgate released my payment even with a dispute on the item and I am unable to get any assistance from DHgate, so I am not too confident about using this app at the moment, you only seem to recieve robot messages from Dhgate gate. \"Buyer beware\". I've uninstalled this app & will never buy from them again! They must hire 10 year olds to develop their app. I just wasted 45 minutes of my life trying to figure out how to add a different credit card so I could purchase their item. You would think it would be under the title \"My Credit Cards,\" but nope, you have to delete the card you have, go in and try to purchase the item at which point since there is no card, it will then ask you for credit card information. What a absolute waste of time.. Used to have loads of nice cheap designer stuff! Now its rubbish and prices have gone up! Don't know what happened! \ud83d\ude41 delivery can take months to! I've tried contacting customer service when needed to, but never get anywhere. Plus it keeps kicking me off the site which is really frustrating, especially when trying to pay! So I give up. Shame! \ud83d\ude41. It crashed quite a few times. Tracking is in a different language and doesn't give you the option to change it. You get to see great items but sometimes it just closes while browsing. Use a prepaid card because my card has been compromised after use. There was a seller who never shipped my item and you can not make a dispute with the seller", "pos": "Negative reviews for DHgate-online wholesale stores app highlight issues with network problems, glitches, and unresponsive customer service.

Awesome! I deleted many games like this, coz they were so boring and repetitive. But this is what i was finding. Interesting, new things to discover, new weapons at each chapter, etc. And i love to fight that giant zombie at the end of each chapter. I hope you'll bring more things with upcoming updates. For me, it's a FIVE STAR GAME \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50.. THIS GAME IS THE BEST EVER! I am obsessed and play on a daily basis multiple times a day. I find myself trying to conquer new levels in different ways than before. Trying to go farther even though I have all the stars in both categories for each level. Now after having beat the hardest chapter which was 7 you have given me chapter 8 to deal with. Please don't tell me this is the end though. With a new weapon, secret corridors, and maze like elevators after beating chapter 8 I need more please!. Its awsome!other people should enjoy this game as much as I do. It is action packed full of adventers and like other games but better yes they could inprove the game to be better but for now they should really just stop with the ads when you die. And should probably add more levels and I kinda like what they did with the world map and the other map. I already killed the forst boss you face when you plaay and it already ggave me a mission to kill three zombie boss's. That is all I want to say now. Love this game thank you so much for fixing the revive cuz when I used to revive I watched an ad then I died right on rspawn but there is a problem when a group of zombies come up to me get stuck then I can't move unless I throw a gurnade and hope to survive or I can just let the zombies kill me which I don't wanna do so please do something about this.. This is a very nice game . I like this game very much . It has hard difficulties as you grow up in your levels . It doesn't need any online connection to play the story mod but you need to be in online to play Daily Challange and get free rewards in 24 hours . Download this , It is a very sweet game with easy controls .. One of the interesting games. Good story mode. It's fun to play. Finished all levels. Bingo!!. I have played this game before and it is awesome I love it but I don't like the fact that you have to buy the other guns and weapons I wish I had to unlock them just by completing more levels so please fix that remove all purchases cuz I'm only 8 years old and I don't have a credit card but this game is super fun please add more levels though. i myself love this game but it should and an online muti-player or like a thing that you can fight other people, but other than that keep up the good work and im 11 btw:). Omg, This is Godly I Love this Game Easy to Control unlike other stickman games ive played! I'M INSANELY happy its even offline so i can play it at school with my friends on the bus. The only problem is theres a picture glitch whenever i get somthing from a ad it stays as the one you equip if i have punch I'll have a gun equipped but I haven't i have punch equiped. The game is the best ever it's so fun but it seems to take ages for me to get new headbands:( but I think there should be new ones thanks great game to:). This is an awesome game to play, theres so much levels to complete,the gameplay is amazing!,and this game is smooth \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d. This game is really fun and easy and you can get a lot of updates , I would say this is first place out of all the games. It's so fun I like that there are barely any ads and also easy to get rich.

Exceptional game, I absolutely love it otherwise I would NOT have spent nearly ten quid in just under 20 mins of playing, so trust me guys I'm a 57 year old avid gamer and this is SPOT-ON it's a simple just plain old fun ( run-n-gun ) game, not all COMPLICATED like some developers make them, anyway ENJOY \ud83d\udc4c!!. This is so scary but fun in my opinion and All the zombies creep me out and when I have low health thats what scares me the most and the comic is fun to read(only once in my opinion when you get pages) and not to brag,but in my opinion I'm pretty good at it and rarley die.. I thought it was gonna be that bad unity games but no, its well set up and its a fun game to play aswell.. I love this game .it has unique guns and weapons to use and you can jump and cling on to stuff there is a lot of dtuff in the game that i didnt expect .it is so much fun i just wish they could add more levels sooner. ABSOLUTELY NO PAY TO WIN !! I keep playing and the comic book Soo good I rate it \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 no glitch no add if not want no pay to win I'm so so so impressed I love it.

Great game, unfortunately randomly it closes down when I open it for days, then randomly works again. My 4 yr old loves the game, and I was hoping to share the love with the game, but it won't work on my phone or my wife's, both are a note 10+. Absolutely disgraceful! I complete a level, watch a 30 second long advert then the screen goes black for two minutes until I cry, \"Enough!\" and force-close the game myself. Piss poor controls make me hate this game more than any I've played in the last two years! Uninstalled!. This game is just terrible. For some reason items dont spawn when you really need them and whenever a item that randomly appeared off screen it always disappears and theres like a 3%- chance you will even get it. Sometimes with guns like sniper,shotgun etc they always do a second shoot even when you let go and the run and jump doesnt work to good. And why do some many zombies appear at the same time so it's a crowd like just make it normal jeez. Fix these and it might not be 1 star. This sucks, there is too many ads. Speed and action??? This has nothing to do with the Stickman character being damn near uncontrollable. It's a zombie game. Meaning it's a n Action/Horror game. If any characters in the game would be uncontrollable and disoriented. It would be the zombies. Most non-infected humans would have greater control over their bodily movements. This is usually what makes a Zombie Hunter. Otherwise, their just another zombie in the horde.. It crashed more times than expected the controls are way too buggy and hard and when i crash i have to do the entire level again i mean i could use the car but its a waste of gas like comon dude fix it. Stopped working, uninstall and reinstall several times the move button stays on even In home.menu and won't let your stickman move but had green login button right side of level, broken game.... The new update suckkkkks!!!!!! I updated just yesterday and it f-ing sucks!. The old one was so fun.. Bring that back... Love the game but the ads make it unplayable ON PURPOSE to force paid ad removal.. This Games Doesn't NOT work on the Samsung Note 20 5G. If it is Connected to Wifi, it stops working, Why?? It work offline only, Why? Developer, Answer!. It was fun until the upgrade... No more sound too much adds after each level it annoying right now I find it hard to play now. limited levels only 6 levels are there there are no any upgrade whithin 1-2 months same charectors,same guns,same levels every time. This was an amazing game but now crashed 6 seconds after it is opened, i would give a 1 start for that but as the game is really entertaining i give it 2 stars. Money minded devs, for some levels u have to pay to progress and its not like such levels are boss levels, even if they are normal levels u have to pay to win. Not playing this game even if its the only game on playstore.. It's worst game , same level , if you lost you will play 5 level back , earned more coin but is not any work , useless coin ,. Overall: It gets more advertisements when you reach higher level, also lagging sometimes. The game design: I need weapons when I face 189 to 200+ zombies! Each level you collect the weapons to shoot them but when you reach higher levels they simply appear less and less and I had to wait like 5 to 6 minutes just to get 1 weapon! Or use my bare hand to fight them (lose everytime cause they're too many)! So I uninstalled this game after playing for 1 month.. one problem : sometimes the zombie too much, so I cannot to kill them, I'm waiting for updates or I'm waiting for stickman vs zombie 2,it will be better if you make another game.. fun game but way to many adds.. dont recommend.

I like this app. It's really very good music making app. It's user interface is too easy. Even a child can make music with the help of Walkband. I am 17 years old and I also made a song with Walkband. It's too easy and user friendly. There are lot of instruments like piano, drum, drum pad, drum machine, guitar and bass etc. Also you can download different effects of these instruments after watching Ads. But it's really amazing. Try it. You will like it.. :) Really good! I used to use GarageBand, but my plan ended. I was looking for an easy, free, GarageBand-like app. This is perfect. Reasons to get: + easy + can record audio + 6+ instruments to record with Reasons not to get: + slight echo when you record audio and listen to the music at the same time + manual save. I use this app for about 5 minutes occasionally to practice & select the keys of a song before I play on my CTK3500 Key board. Very help full app. Especially Chords are very good. Best app ever made. Thanks to all your team. I never tried other options like mixer, recording etc. I use only piano key to find keys of a song..

Try it. You will like it.. I've tried out other apps and this one is the best sounding and most responsive one I've played that is the closest to a real guitar and bass instrument app. You can play chords and play pretty fast without it messing up. The touch is really and response speed and flow is really good. Most bass and guitar apps are garbage people just make and put on here but don't actually put any effort to make quality. I'm a musician and I like this. It's really nice.. I initially disliked this app but now that I understand what it's actually for, I love it. This is not an instrument simulator. What it *is* is a songwriting tool. You can easily try out chord progressions that come to your mind, play them in different keys, etc, then share them with people for feedback, all with less work and better quality than it would take to record a demo manually. Hey, Revo Team, you've been working hard at fixing this app. The mp3 converter sounds great; furthermore, this will always be my primary music making software; even though, I've moved on to bigger territory. Again, thanks for the hard work and an amazing app. \ud83d\udcbf\ud83d\udcbe\ud83c\udfb9\ud83c\udfbc. Instrument Requests; Keyboard: Tuba, French Horn, Clarinet, Guitar, Celeste, Tubular Bells, Pizzicato Strings, Muted Trumpet, Trombone, Dulcimer, Balalaika, Choir, Sine Wave Synthesizer. Drum Kit (Pad): 8-Bit Kit, Marching Band Kit, Orchestral Percussion. Can you add these please? I would appreciate it. Thank you for listening to my feedback.. THIS Is a fantastic app And I made lot of music in it. But the only thing I would prefer to the owner is: You can create a group with anyone and discuss about music like collaboration. Only we can message in walk band instead or this we can have group discussions on music . I WISH THIS TO HAPPEN.And the next thing is you guys have done wonderful in perfect piano app why can't you do the same in walk band. I wish that also will come soon.My message box is not working I hope you fix this issues \ud83d\ude0a. It's a lovely and fab app. I am using this app since 2 months and I am really satisfied with this virtual gift. I really gives me the vibes of real instrument. I will prefer everyone to use this application.. Its very amazing and cool application which helps you to create sense of music, you can make your own music which gives your skills a free space to discover the huge universe of music \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd1f\ud83e\udd1f\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83e\udd1f\ud83e\udd1f, there is only one problem i am unable to play multiple keys in one time I can only play with two fingers, and if iam putting more than two then only two keys are working, sometime iam unable to play with two fingers, please do fix the problem if possible, thank you \ud83e\udd1f\ud83e\udd1f\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83e\udd1f\ud83e\udd1f. I love this app. I reccomend this app to everyone that I know that plays music. It is amazing! You can record on so many instruments that would normally be out of reach due to the cost. It's great for beginners or professionals. Great for making beats or backing tracks. The absolute best all in one studio you can get on your phone. And best of all... it's FREE!!! I could go on but I know I only get 500 characters here. So I'll just say this, do yourself a favor and download this app.. This app is a handy to use as a notebook for those spontaneous riff, song, and lecture ideas. I use it all the time. It's easy to use. I only use it for guitar, bass, and voice tracks, so I can't speak to the other features. Highly recommended if you're always wishing you could record that riff real quick before you forget it, cause you know it happens.. Honestly, super fun app. I've had it on multiple phones and it's great to fiddle around with and keep up on my knowledge of progressions and such. there's nothing like the real thing, but this helps sub til you can get to it. piano feature is the highlight, but you can do quite a lot if you're patient. i reccomend 14 keys for your piano, but scale to your phone size if needed. thank you guys for this, I'd lose a lot of music knowledge if it wasn't for this. I and other broke musicians thank you. App works great, has lots of features and overall they listen to people's issues. They fixed the storage issue that I was having quickly and efficiently. Thank you for fixing that issue by the way!. Walk Band is one of the best app for music lovers. Its a Androids GarageBand. I practice on it everyday while travelling. In terms of functionality, UI and UX is just perfect. I dont know any app better than this. Thanks to the owner and his efforts. I loved this app and would recommend to all music lovers and even to the new aspirants in music. Best wishes from Shiv, India.. I <3 this app! The graphics are attractive and it's easy to navigate, I think it will be helpful in learning about music. The sounds are quite pleasant and there's many fun options. Update 2021/01/01: Very useful app. The best synthesizer app the world has ever seen. Top quality.. This app is incredible. For someone who wants to start being able to use actual music equipment, this app is perfect. It's easy to use and there are literally no adds. You could add a note option for like 1/4 , 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64 of a note to be able to sync your music. Add some more. I have an android 9 if that gives any information.", "neg_reviews": "Hi walkband developers, the app is awesome. I've made many song covers with this app. You might ask why did you rate us with 1 star, the reason is because yesterday all my songs just disappeared and I don't know how to get them back. This shouldn't have happened \ud83d\ude15. * PLEASE READ IF YOU HAVE USED ANOTHER MUSIC APP/DAW I am a music producer, and I used this app to jot down ideas. I recorded a melody, but it didn't save. Other than that, the quality and sound of the virtual instruments are terrible, the user interface of the playlist arrangement is horrible, and the recording of instruments are actually recorded via your external device microphone. Maybe good for a 6 year old. If you have used another music making app, don't waste your time with this one.. I find the fact that I can't copy a segment of a track into a different track to be abhorrently non intuitive. I've basically been using this to teach myself music theory, and tbh it's going good. But I have a track I'm working on and it has 3 instruments at the start. I want them to harmonize and then loop. Problem is my recording has just a few seconds of deadair at the start. No biggie just trim it copy and paste right? Nope I have to individually trim each instruments track. So stupid\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20. I'm still gonna use this app, but there is alot of flaws that should be fixed. First of all, if you are trying to make a song, it just randomly speeds up mid-song and ruins everything, that needs to be fixed. And lastly, it's just dumb that you need to pay VIP for half of the instruments! And it costs \u00a37, \u00a37! The good part about walk band is that the instruments are affective and easy to fit in, well, easy to fit in most of the time.. Nah. It's not BAD, but I have a hard time finding some of the most basic features an app line this should have. Snapping stuff to a grid (moving clips around/splitting them right on beat, duplicated patterns are always slightly off beat because of this), resizing patterns, selecting and moving multiple notes/patterns at once and much more. I've used it for 20 minutes and I already don't enjoy using this app. There is more but I can't put it all in this review. Can't really recommend this.. Lowering my review once again, because this instrument deletion glitch is getting annoying. I have created amazing melodies, only to find them gone. And I have saved the project, so I don't understand what happened.. Pretty cool. Edit - looked good at first glance, but it's not. 1) Pressing \"STOP\" jumps the focus back to beginning which makes it very frustrating when trying to work with tracks longer than a minute. 2) recorded a simple beat on the drum machine but the app can't playback it without stuttering lagging. Useless.. I don't like how hard it is to make a song or even a melody! I finally made a beat that I was happy about but when I recorded it and put it into the Multi track, the beat was not the same and sounded worse than the original beat. And also everything is confusing and hard to wrap you head around. I'm only going to rate it 2 stars because I did get to have one beat and it can be saved but besides that it's hard.. I could rate the app 5 stars but I can't. The app itself is good but when I export it as an mp3 file the quality of the music drops. My biggest issue is that the tempo suddenly speeds up or slows down ruining the whole song making it unable to continue.. The piano is almost impossible to play on beat, because of the delay. There's also a huge problem with the midi to mp3 converter. For some reason it messes up the different instruments, and I cannot seem to do anything about it. It's extremely annoying, I have the paid version and I can't even save the songs without a messed up midi.. Recording doesn't get saved if it goes past 2 bars, recordings in different categories are not available in the song mixing pane (only browsing the file system is), the audio playback quickly stopped working. Repositioning recordings is not available, or at the very least not user friendly. In addition to bugs and missing functionality that render the app almost impossible to use (I don't even know whether that would be possible), it displays an ad what feels like every few seconds.. I've been working on the project for hours, and now some parts of the instrument are missing even though I've saved them. and this application also has many bugs and errors, I don't recommend this app for making music (DAW), I recommend the FL Studio Mobile app for making music better.. I've been working on the project for hours, and now some parts of the instrument are missing even though I've saved them. and this application also has many bugs and errors, I don't recommend this app for making music (DAW), I recommend the FL Studio Mobile app for making music better.. There is no facility of recording voice with background music. This should be improve with tuning facility. It will help too many people who can't afford a musical band or recording expenses to record their songs.. Somewhat fun, but useless for real composing. You can't load previously recorded tracks into new songs (the Multitrack synth), a part for the first track, so you always have to start anew. When adding a track, the editor allows to load previously recorded tracks but there's no way to use them in the current song.. I'm sick of this app, as good as some of the features are, the flaws easily cancel them out. \u00b9Three times I was editing my recorded music which took me each about 40 minutes each & just as I'm about to finish my project the app crashes & I lose all my progress. \u00b2Why can't you edit a track without stopping it? It's such a pain to go to the beginning of the song everytime you want to edit a single beat. \u00b3Once you add more than a single melody per line, they just merge together when you try edit. There are a lot of bugs in this app right now .I have used this before but this hasn't happened to me. when I press three fingers on a keyboard it seems like it's stuck also on the drum kit the drum left to the big one sometimes doesn't play I use Redmi Note 4. i cant find my own made mp3 file and midi file anywhere. I worked hard composing a music and it isnt anywhere in files directory. and when i try to share it in app it shows no app can perform this action, what the hell???? WHERE ARE THE MUSIC SAVED, REVONTULET SOFT Inc??. I really gave this app a chance. On the keyboard, the delay between touch and sound was terrible. Unfortunately, the drum set had an even worse delay, like 5 times worse. The Final straw was when the drum machine literally sounded like a beginner drummer with no rhythm. The machine literally could not keep tempo. Even the generated beats sound like a beginner drummer. I'm not trying to be harsh, but the app is unusable. The lack of information is concerning as well. I expected much more.. This app keeps disappointing me. I can't wait it will be out of my phone very soon 1. I download plugins to use, but it takes two days to disappear. Why can't you let me download only one time hmm? 2. When am about finishing my project, the tracks loses control. I start to get crazy as my track getting out of the beat and my volume balance change. 3. This app become a stupid when converting into mp3 coz Some instrments ar muted at all. So, I can't wait again!

I showed it to my friend and he was not able to differentiate between this and CS:GO. The graphics are great, controls are smooth and the gameplay is just top notch. Now I come to know why this has 4.6 ratings. The matchmaking system is also very good. I would highly recommend this. It will give nostalgia of old Counter strike days. Hats off to the developers. 100 out of 10.. This game is absolutely great! The guns look awesome, the player models are amazing and the sounds are great. The only two problems I have with the game is that, some of the guns need to be balanced just a bit more (Like the AK-47), and the matchmaking needs to be updated just a bit, but other than that, amazing. The game is great, theres nothing pay to win about this game which is hard to come about in many shooters now a days, the skins are stunning even the common ones, there are two currencies in the game which can both be either grinded or bought. The graphics are phenomenal, and so is the sound effects. Sometimes it's hard to believe that this game is still in its beta. I wish nothing but more sucess to the team who is working on this game\ud83d\udc4d.. Graphics are way too good. One of the best game if you are a CS(counterstrike) lover. There is no aim assist ( so you only depend on your skills - which is a good thing) . Overall a very good game. I would recommend. But there are hackers which pull down the experience. Arms race is one of the worst mode ( according to me) and village is the worst map(according to me).. one of the best competitive fps for mobile, if not the best. has a great base to stand on so far, but would enjoy more maps and skins, however, even with what we have now, this game stands strongly on its own two feet without a need for shoving ads down your throat to make their money. ads are optiokal in this game, and act as a way to increase profits earned from matches, and completely optional. the loot box system is great, however the only only problems it faces will be compltely fixed with. One of the best first person shooter games on mobile if not the best! Pros: runs on high fps even if the graphics are maximum, completely customisable gameplay, no ads(unless you watch ads for coins but you can watch only 3 a day), you can have fun with friends, everything is having epic details, smooth gameplay, a lot of fun. Cons: maps are small, gameplay is sometimes short, gold is hard to get, having a knife skin for free is almost impossible, not a big gameplay. \u26a0\ufe0f: overheats your phone.. Great game! The controls are good and the graphics and fps, which is about 60, are impressive considering I have a Samsung j7. I do sometimes get a invisible mag, but it's only a visual glitch. I haven't played the new update while typing this, but I will change the review if I need to. Overall, this is probably the best fps on the Google App Store.. I've palyed almost every shooting game available on play store and yet not found a better game than this. Gun game score system is unfair because 1 knife kill = 1level up. People play that mode with knife only. And in my opinion knife kill is much easier than a gun kill. Please fix scoring system.. Awesome game that I've been playing on and off since 2019. One thing I'd love for you to do is to unlock all weapons for the escalation mode. And could you start adding more maps as well? That'd be great. Oh and fix your coin system. Your entire reward system sucks! Cases are extremely costly and you get like 5 3 coins per match regardless of your performance.. No joke. This is one of the best fps games on mobile. It's fun to control and easy to get used to, with multiple strategies and llaystylea. The small maps makes team play easier, while still being challenging. With the new update, I'm gonna be playing a lot more. The only real things I would want for this game is controller support. Single player practice would be nice too, and playing on LAN would make playing w friends easier. I really like it. It's fun, takes some time to master, and has a decent selection of weapons and maps. The maps do get repetitive eventually, but they're mostly pretty good so it's not too bad. I have noticed some players that appear to be hacking though (100 kills, nothing but headshots), which can definitely make a match frustrating, but it's not super common. Overall, very fun.. Great game overall but there's one problem the controls are weird and it took me a long time to find the reload button and there are some bugs that need to be fixed. But great game I would like to see more! I've gotten used to the game and it's quite easy. Also I would like it to be like once your level 20 you get a free case so I can get a cool skin also the cases are a little pricey but it is definitely worth the gold for a case. But yeah keep up the good work bois. My favourite mobile game at the moment. Controls well for a mobile game, ads are completely optional, skins can be completely free depending on how much time you're willing to put in. Only complaint is that gold is a little expensive for what it is in my opinion. I've run into a few hackers but that's to be expected in any game, especially free ones.. This is the best CS:GO mobile game out there. Games like standoff 2 are underrated and have a lot of great potential. The game's graphics are into another level, servers are amazing and most of all, everything including the skins and the maps are extremely detailed. I really love to give the developers a hats off for such a unique and different video game out there. It really must be a \"try it out\" game for everyone. One of the best mobile games I've ever played. I've played this game around when it first came out it was a bumpy start for sure but to present day the game is amazing. It also has some of the best Competitive game play and super cool gun skins. I also love how you can customize the controls it really help me out with being comfortable while playing a Ranked game.. great game However I would recommend improvements on network coverages in some countries.. especially for Nigeria.. I love counter strike and it's basically that on mobile. It's super fun and enjoyable. Though I wish every time you won a match you would get a little bit more money. The crates are only a hundred coins. The gameplay is great and so are the graphics. The controls are easy and I haven't encountered any bugs or problems yet. Play this if you love fps games.. The game is good, real good. It's a very nice CSGO like game, the graphics are nice also the gameplay, it really requires skill just to be good at the game also it is really competitive but the thing I just don't like is the movement, it lacks movement the movement speed is good but the switching between left and right is really hard everytime you will swipe left and right to jiggle peek it just go slow because of the middle part of the joystick.. The game overall is amazing the graphics are nice the leg is a little much. but I mean I guess that's what you get when you cross a bunch of bullets flying everywhere on a mobile game. the firearms are pretty good I guess there should be a bigger selection on them but the worst part about the game is lack of firearms and that's not even a big problem so yeah.. if you love counter-strike, then you would definitely love this game. i just hope the creators are reading this review coz' there seems to be a problem with servers. the queing takes too long before you can connect to a game.and when i play with some friends, sometimes we cant connect to the same game and it also take too long before we can connect.please creators, fix your servers. but overall it is still an excellent game.", "neg_reviews": "In every mobile fps game, to face against emulator users was frustrating. My advice was that, if you're not good enough to beat them, you can skip this one cuz there seems to be no penalty for emulator users and if you got emulator, you can play this so that you can have fun. Mobile users, you can use external controllers to help you but still, there's no better than mouse and keyboard. Play on your own pace cuz if you're using mobile phones and you wanna go competitive, you'll be wrecked.. it always makes me mad because I want to like the game but when ever I get to that spot where you have to choose whether you want to be counter terrorists or terrorists, it like freezes. So, I'm giving you a chance to up date it or just fix the bug because like I said I think it CAN be a really fun game... but I cant say anything bc I've n ed versa been able to play it.\ud83d\ude21. What a garbage update. Movement feels like one is walking on mushy fecal matter now instead of being fluid, precise and dynamic. The added tagging is the most retarded thing I've ever heard of and the main reason I do not enjoy CS. Why you'd remove the option to reset the animation during the switching of weapons is also beyond me. Stop pleasing the retarded CS-kiddies by slowing the game down and rather stick to making a game that is actually enjoyable.. This game is really bad, do not download. Its just a piece of trash and takes up most of your time trying to get past the loading screen. If anybody asks me which game to play that is like Counter Strike, I will recommend anything else other than this game. I am not sure if I should call this trash a game (I mean that this app is garbage). I wish i could give this garbage 0 stars. It feels like the bugs are a feature of this app/Garbage, they are never fixed. Also this is a garbage ripoff of CSGO. This game is everything I could ever ask for! Fluid gameplay, good controls, good matchmaking, it's really crazy that all this is on a mobile. However I would love to have a in-game voice chat feature. It would be really helpful to communicate with my team and the overall experience of the game. Overall, great job for the game guys. You have really nailed it!. The game is a good idea in itself, yet the gameplay is not. There is a lot of lag although my ping stays under 100 most of the time. The arms race mode is very indecisive on whether it wants to give you a new weapon every kill or every 5 kills. There are also speed hackers (which may be due to the lag). Overall a good idea but poor execution.. I would have given this game a 5 star rating. But, and it's a big but , not only me but most of the players are facing a problem after this new winter update, the problem is that we can't add friends any more nor we can receive any friend requests and the friends list shows empty all the time. Please fix this, please... I really love this game but after this I'm a bit disappointed, I wanted to play with my friend but I can't, so please fix this \ud83d\ude4f. Amazing game! 5 stars! Oops, did I misclick? Ah, must be the usual stutter that occurs just as I'm about to get into a duel. Maybe the random [Invalid position=xx] also kicked in and teleported my character to press the 1 star? Sarcasm aside, did I seriously get a duplicate skin in the SECOND skin level in the BP? Like, I don't really care if I only get rare skins, but a duplicate on the second one itself? There were literally 3 others to choose from just for the rare tier. Damn, amazing.. Devs are not responding to the community, why can't you fix your servers they are very irritating. Also add some \"big\" maps , the maps are too small and all you do is rush and can't camp properly. Damn these maps. Also there are missing hitmarks and amount of hackers are a lot and they ruin the experience of competitive. And yes stop banning people if they are matched with hacker because sometimes we don't know whom we matched with.. by the time i first play this game, i like it, but what changed my mind is the matchmaking system, its very- very unbalance, the last time i played, the number of players on my team including myself is 2 players, but the number of players on other team, is 5 or 6, i don't really count it but i am sure that the other team players is more than the double of my team including myself. you really have to fix this. And what's whit that ping? That's so high everybody freezes and I died being shot at. Much like csgo. I would like to see more content and updates, more control customization (extra fire button), better servers, and get rid of people using plugins and emulators. Also fix the recoil on five seven and tec9 if you could please. UPDATE: I've invested too much time into this game to still be playing servers full of hackers and plugin users. PUT THEM ON THEIR OWN SERVER FOR GOD'S SAKE!. I am editing this review I gave a while back.... At that time the game was very stable...very much fun... Me and my friends used to play it a lot.... But recently... The game way too much trash... Custom game match starting takes ages... And even if we try to cancel it... The button does not respond for like a minute... I am very sad to give a good game like this such a review... But that's the truth... Please do something and save the game... It has a lot of potential in it... But of no use... The game itself is pretty good, also the graphics are decent but the only major problem that cannot be overlooked is the poor optimization of the servers. Even with \"really good\" internet the game suffers from high ping issues. Also I don't know why, but the Indian server was the most problematic and instead of fixing it, they just totally removed the server. THIS ISSUE IS SEVERE AND MAKES THE GAME UNPLAYABLE.. Very good game, my only complaint is there are very few maps, 3 i believe, if their was around 6 or 7 maps, it would be much better. It would help give the game some more variety EDIT: Ever since the latest update servers have been horrendous, i literally can't even play TRAINING without it kicking me out and saying it cant connect to servers. I have restarted the app and my phone multiple times and it is still happening. Not to mention all the other bugs from the update like hands being missing. Bugs and Glitches. The game would be excellent if not for the bugs and glitches that occur. It usually runs fine until the end of the game where it shows connection error. It is really annoying because it kicks me out off the game and I don't get the rewards.. Bad game. 10/10 for the graphics but this is very bad game why? Here's the reason why this game is so bad 1. I encountered a hacker and kill us in one shot and he is invincible 2. My ping goes high even my wifi connection is good 3. The movement is really SLOW and it's so hard to dodge. I hope you imporove the game also can you add report button so we can report hackers because they are really annoying.. I can't start the game!!! I had a lot of progress made in my account I also made many in game purchases....but whenever I log in, it shows a dialogue box with something, \"RPCEXCRPTION\" and then a bunch of digits of numbers in the bracket. Please, do something about it!!!! I loved the game a lot, and I can't bear to lose it!!!. Absolutely terrible. The controls are one of the worst I've ever seen and even when I changed them to better suit me it still felt clunky and out of control. The amount of times I died in my very first match due to spawn trapping is unbelievable. As a note to the developer you might aswell take the game off the Play Store because it is absolute garbage.. This game is out for 4 years already yet the most basic problems haven't been fixed. The servers are straight out trash, even with strong internet connection you still have high ping ang delay actions. Cheaters are still prominent now and then and there is no report feature. Head hitboxes and the damage multipliers in the neck and shoulder should be fixed. Matchmaking should be fixed and points added/deducted after a competitive match should be justified/optimized. Please fix your game Axlebolt.. Its perfect to he honest, but i gave 2 stars rating because when all of your teammates disconnected and when you wanted to leave too, it will ban you from playing another match and demote your rank, and if you don't want to get ban, you need to fight all alone of 5 enemy and there is absolutely not a single chance where you can fight your enemy, please make the game more fair", "pos": "Standoff 2 is highly praised by users for its stunning graphics, smooth controls, and engaging gameplay reminiscent of Counter-Strike. Players particularly appreciate the well-designed gun models, impressive sound effects, and the lack of pay-to-win elements.

Users enjoy the variety of game modes, especially \"Deathmatch\" and \"Defuse the bomb,\" and find the map designs to be well-executed, although some call for greater map variety.

I don't even think that there should be more levels because in most of the levels, there are four rooms! If you were to add in another level in a future update, maybe you could add in a clinic for injured students, empty classrooms, etc. Thank you \ud83d\ude43. Well--you did it again, Toca Boca. But, what's there not to like about this game?The characters are fun, new, crazy and cool. Chill out in your apartment if you like--but there's lot to do! Mix beats-- or dance instead! Well--if that's not your type, you can play sports! Still no? You can go skating. Not that? No need to go far, you can paint here too! Well... if you've rejected all those you can get a snack... Or maybe you should stay in your apartment and chill.. Uhm... hi toca I wasn't sure where to put this but I have a suggestion for a toca life game (I absolutely love these games by the way) I thought that it would be like a toca life supernatural with vampires, werewolves, fairys, witches, stuff like that. There would be like a bar/club for vampires a woods for werewolves like a magic shop (I dont know?) For witches and then a elegant type place for fairys. This is all just suggestions for a game. I love your games either way\ud83d\ude01. I hadn't actually played the game but I have a good feeling about it. But I have one tiny wincy little question. Why aren't any of your toca life games free? I have been adding toca games to my talent for years now and all of the good ones are free. I was about to put this toca city video on my tablet to post it to my friends. So I got to the play screen and saw a little square at the bottom corner and it was the game. I watched the trailer. Cool. So I bought it. That's how I found out about the game.. I love this app and I reccomend anyone who has it to get toca world (it's free) to add it to their world! You also basically get toca city for free anyway.. By far the best purchase I've made when it comes to tour games. I'm 11 and had so much fun using my creativity. There are so many things too do and it's a great time killer. Absolutely would recommend if you're looking for a way to experiment with your imagination!. This game is so much fun! me and my sister love this game !!!!!. I love this game its so fun and you can play with different people and there's so much cool items and cool houses and rooms in the houses another thing that I really like to do is the painting one the painting one is where you can use spray paint or just paint normally and use different colors and when your done your painting you can make it come out in a frame and you can chose what type of frame design and what type of frame color I love this game so much and I have all of your other games \u2764\ud83d\ude0a. This game is fun when I go to the Toca Boca normal when I go there I just wait and the Toca after school come and build it so it's so much fun. This game is so good because it's just like a doll house and it's a very nice game u can put your home like u want and u can even make it like a story with the character's and stuff. and btw if ur screen is white or the game doesnt work its not really the creator's fault because for others its working and it's a really good GAME!\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\u2764\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c. This is the best game and I like the hoverboard and the skateboards. This is the best game ever I don't care about the price it's 100% 3 inside it so amazing I can go on my skateboard and do some food and go to bed now after school. This is a great game and I can't wait for toca WORLD but I think that you should make a Harry potter game it would be super popular you could have Hogwarts , diagon ally ,hogs mead, the dursly's house \ud83c\udfe0 you can make shops like the broom shop and olivanders which is the wand shop you could even include the bank \ud83c\udfe6 I am sure it would be sooooooo popular !!!. I love this app so so so much i play it everywhere and every day and time of the year or weekend or week's it's the best game in the history of games it's mind blow\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude00. I love this app I think it is very good game for children and adults \ud83d\udc4d It's a really good game and it does not have any adds either. I absolutely love it and I'm 9 years old and I just figured out if you buy Toca life games adds to Toca life world which I think is awesome only down part is that it's $4 per person and I have to pay my parents $4. Another fun Toca Boa app. You can paint, skate, make music and dress up all the characters. Four areas to do what you wanna do. This series just keeps getting better and better. :) try the Toca Boca School too-. this game is so fun to play I totally recommend!! it's an awesome game to play it's fun to make characters and more I hope you enjoy if you have played it ^,^ Byeeeeee.

The problem appears to be fixed. I like this game because it offers so many different types of games. Still need to work on the price for credits to play. Credits go quickly at 5000-1000 as the lowest bet. But still enjoy playing. The variety of games is a definite plus. The updates to this game are definite improvements. Thanks for listening to the users!!! Just adding that it is still my favorite game.. Still my favorite game, and still free,thanks Rocket for a cool game and lots of bonuses, remember to be covid safe and aware while gaming, Viva Slots Vegas, let's fly high Rocket!, It just keeps getting better, the higher payouts, challenges R D \ud83d\udca3, 5 ***** +*****5 , 4 Most improved, true to Vegas Style, and Hospitality 4 putting up with me!. I've probably tried all the bigger known slot games on the app store and this one is by far my favorite. The option of machines are great, there are always fun limited time machines, and progressive jackpot prizes. The only thing I dislike is that I can't personalize my avatar and I LOVE that this app asked nothing about your Facebook information. Thank you for that! \u2661. Hands down the best slots game in the play store. The developers have done a fantastic job to make this slot game the most realistic (as far as overall odds, the look, the feel, game choice, etc.), the funnest, and incredibly easy to play and get in on all the rewards without having to sit through all the ads! Come to think of it, the only time you ever even see an ad is if you choose to watch one. Great game. I love everything about it!. This is new. It's fun and the best slots I ever played. Great bonuses. Top notch. Support staff very helpful and friendly.. Love this app!...love the machines I could play all day long...Give me a big Jackpot and you'll be able to see how much I like these slots and how long I'll play! Thanks Guys!! ...It's been a few month now since my last review and I can say for certain this app is my favorite. Thanks guys \ud83d\udc4d. I really enjoy this casino app. one of the best things for me is that I'm not forced to play a certain amount of coins..in other apps they force you by automatically raising your coin amount which you normally can't lower but, if it can be lowered it slows down and you don't hit anymore wins. Viva Slot Vegas does not lower the speed of their machines and that makes you feel better when your playing. I don't feel like they are trying to drain my pocket book.... I have noticed many new changes,such as...\"the New Sherriff in Town!\" He claims... more bonus coins more frequently and worth more each time, and 2 other really awesome \"new things!\" Those of us who play these kinds of games honestly, REALLY appreciate stuff like that. I mean, I do believe I speak for us all when I say, FINALLY! \ud83d\ude01 As for the app, Download it. It does have several really catchy games. Oh!!!! \ud83e\udd13 Even if your internet is down, this \ud83c\udfb0 still works!!! LOVE THAT!!!. (The Pro's are)..The games are realistic and fun..more like the old standard slot machines i love..(Cons)..When I purchase credits and I do purchase alot..it seems they don't last long..the machines don't hit, and my credits are used up quickly..Basically I enjoy these games alot and even with the Pro's and Cons I still give them 5 stars...(Revised)..your credits don't go far, the machines seem tighter than ever... I really like these slots, but; I have to spin I counted 18 times to win, the slot is the one with the palm trees, every 10 spin you win, then you loose the coins. It's suppose to be exciting to play these slots. But we loose more coins then wins. I'm staying @ 500 a spin. Let's win more to have more people down load this game. The graphics are nice.. Evenin\u2019 \ud83e\udd70.I\u2019ve been playing different casino for many years. Here\u2019s a story Who has installed it? why is there such a problem with constant ads? \ud83d\ude2d the app is cool, as far as I know here you can play only for virtual coins unlike my favorite game with fastgraphics - topslots.pro, where you can play for real money, without annoying ads. Even just out of curiosity test! Right now they offer free additional gifts and have \ud83c\udfb0! If you checked it press \u201clike\u201d! \ud83d\udc4d. I love the game but here lately it's been taking more than it's been giving, the double fall on the line and then it takes it away, but I still will give it a 5 star because I love the game love this game but you didn't give me points for my review just now love it I'm still loving the games still the best game I've played great game. If I wanted to lose this much I'd go to the casino for real.. Great slots! Lotsof fun. These are good old fashioned reels slots which are my favorite kind. They are very realistic. I love to play! I love the variety, so many games to choose from.. Viva Slot Vegas. an environment with active slot machines. A place to play games and experience joyous moment with or without friends, everyone seems cordially active. A place to collect lots of coins when paying games. No time for boredom, or wasted, a time for Joy. Utilizing efficient fingers to achieve a goal of coins. There, I experienced fun with sounds of coins in reflection of lightflaches and won million of coins.. I have plaid a lot of slot games for n bit of entertainment. This is one of the most fun apps. It's colourful and allows you to play and have fun without loosing all your coins in a few minutes and then all the in-house purchases starts. There isn't a thousand ads and things popping up the whole time! What a fun game to play! It's a must play!. I've only been playing for a few days now , and so far it's been okay. The payouts have been very fair and there's been no glitches or hickups during gameplay. This far, this has been one of the best casino apps I've played yet. I hope this positive streak continues.

Great slots lots of fun,, I promise this site is not like the other one that let you win then good bye, and all the winning stops. Unless you buy point, then you will win for a short time, and you can believe me for I have played so many sites, that I can't count them. The slots are like the one you would play in a casino.. Still having a great time playing ! Lots of fun games and huge variety. Nice to not have 10 million side games and pop ups. Really like the Simple small amount of daily challenges etc you can do to earn a reasonable amount of coins. Really enjoy this one. Also really love the pick a prize machines. Really like the new bingo nice \ud83d\udc4c to have long time frame on it", "neg_reviews": "If i could give 0 stars that is what you would get! When i tried to open your game today i was back to level 1 and all coins were gone. Because of that i am gone as well!. like the game a lot, however after playing daily for over two months. I am sad to say I have had enough of fighting the fake players, aka \"BOTS\" that make me spend more credits to beat them. please don't lie to us and say there are not any, I have plenty of screen shots to back it up. You have 72 hours to fix this problem or it's uninstall time. thanks for wasting coins that I purchased with real life cash.... I've Been Playing Viva Slots Vegas Many Months, Never Had Much of A Problem. Unfortunately, Today, You Took Over A Billion Credits From ME Because of Your Company Errors. I\"d Play Games Bet 3 - 6 Million, and Win 6 - 24 Million Credits and Be the Tournament Winner, I'd Always Check Credits Won Making Sure I Had Correct Amount. Today, I Get a Message Saying Your Company Had Game Errors Causing Problems for Some Players. Be Fair & 100% Sure You Select The Correct Players to Deduct Credits From !. Love the games. But they give you some good wins and turn around and take it all back. Still like the games. Just makes me mad sometimes. I hate this new game . It sucks will not play anymore. You took all the credits away in the beginning. The few you did leave let's you play all of two minutes. Lousy .I don't know what you were thinking that this new version would be fun. I've been playing this game for a number of years and it was my favorite of all the slot games. Should have left it alone. This slot game used to be fun, but somehow someone is rigging the 1st place position so you can't get there. It's happened before and now 1st place is at 1,870,000 and you can't get there on a 5,000 coin bet. Money hungry much? It's now set to 1,775,000 as 1st place on every game! Give people a chance to win maybe. I would not recommend this one to anyone. Seems all they want you to do is buy more chips. BEWARE!. Worst waste of $25 in my life...Save Your Money!!! You don't even hit anything when you pay. It went through 150000 points in less than 5 minutes. not fun at all!! so sad as I don't mind paying...but when it's not fun...well, no money for you!!! I can't stress enough...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!. Nice slots but theres only one game open after we've down loaded the game, when you advertised another??? Its like you are forced to pay that game hope that you get through that game and another game opens up. Open all give us a choice of what we would like to play the player might like that particular game. Honestly the reason i downloaded the app is because i like the game you advertised.. been playing this game about 6 years. Spent hundreds of dollars buying points, and had access to every game. Today, all of a sudden, you have to agree to their terms. suddenly, they wiped out years of progress and took back almost $800,000 dollars and started back at game 1, with only $2000 to start. I am super pissed and i hope nobody else ever plays this game and gets screwed over. I'm done with these greedy pigs.. I spinned 30 times didn't win a thing. Not fun, uninstalling.. Totally amazing! The 2x, 3x, 4x and 5x icons hit almost every time, the only problem is it's always one above the line or one below. You would think with that \"luck\" they would hit on the pay line once in awhile! If you do happen to get the 2x it will be alone. Not worth the time to download. You want me to buy coins, give me a fun game I can play awhile and win not just watching losing spins.. Worst game I've ever played. started with over 12 mil and it took it in a matter of minutes. So like most ripoff slot games when you purchase they let you rack up unbelievable wins. Well not this game. I purchased $25 worth of coins and less than half hour later they were gone. Totally dead and lifeless game. Don't waste your time. Game is designed to rip you off!!. Can't get into the game for the last week ,has played it for years and this happens ,need to fix it I miss my game so much not having problems with any other games just this one,will not load.. Garbage!!! Must be really ignorant people that play this ranking so high. I played about 3 weeks. Watched a milion ads just to try and hit something good. Nope. Lose 20 spins in a row, change slots and lose some more. Nice graphics means squat if you don't win. If you don't win it's not fun. If it's not fun it doesn't deserve anything over one star. Hence, ignorant people play this.. Takes too long to get to the interesting slots. I am not interested in just pressing buttons for credits. I want some interesting play features, such as spin wheels. That is what I saw in the advertisement, and was the reason why I installed this in the first place. I did not like the fact that I had to wait to get to the interesting games. I felt like I was wasting my time, playing boring games, trying to level up.. Its an okay game. Now I know why they give credits out more often than the other casino's. You lose them fast. And what they want you to pay for credits is a joke. I would never buy credits from this casino. It cost's an arm and a leg. Who set's these prices? They need too be terminated...but, they do have nice graphics.. with the new update , im uninstalling. Sure you might get bigger payouts for challenges but you are spending more than you get.Just wanting you to spend money ..so im out..have been playing and had built up to almost 1B coins..but that was gone within one challenge.thank you for ruining it.. Any slot game that can gaive 10-30 spins each on three slot machines and give zero wins is a joke and waste of time. This one does that. And with so many to chose from in the play store, it's idiotic to take everything from players. Nobody is seeing your ads etc if they just uninstalled your app to try another.... I have had a terrible experience with the Viva Slots management team. I played the Fathers Day slot with maximum bets of 6 million winning 32 billion credits. Suddenly all my credits were taken off as the machine had a glitch apparently. I was disappointed to say the least. They gave me back only 128 million credits back. Totally unfair and unjust. They refuse to budge or change their decision. Terrible people. Beware and be warned... Horrible. Went through 450 spins on a single game not 1 bonus or free spin awarded. Cant contact the game through the app because it tells me off line when I'm clearly not. So customer support is no where to be found. And the only reason I know 450 spins is because i completed the daily tasks of 100 spins 150 spins and 200 spins to get my wonderful rewards of 50k credits that i of course lost. These machines look great but they don't payout right. It isn't a lot of fun to spin the reels 4 or 5 times on small bets and lose every single time. That's Rockets scheme.

It's also amazing how the devs are still supporting this game. EDIT: I think it's better if the Potion count increased past 197, this gives more incentive to grind after maxing out.. This game is a super fun endless runner! I have been playing it for several years now and the devs are great, they keep adding more goals for us to get to making it more fun.

Its actually pretty fun i wouldnt spend actual money on this yet but i do like the art style and the game play some of the offers could be a little better on the in game store but other than that i cant wait to see what updates are to come to the game. It has managed to keep me away from my usual game that i play religiously every day for 3 whole years and have invested over 1600 dollars into. I see great potential for a whole lot more in this game. The game is so much fun and can even be cute. The events are amazing. The outfits are adorable. And the game is so unique for an endless runner. I highly recommend it. The zombies are just hilarious with thier noises and it's honestly a great way to keep someone entertained.. I absolutely love this game! I love the concept of it but have some ideas maybe! Maybe you should upgrade it to where you can upgrade faster like for instance the options take so long to fill up so I would love to make it a little faster please! Also I would like it if you could by locked things with coins! These are just ideas for maybe future updates sooo yea totally recommend !. Used to have this on an older phone years ago, recently found it again and it's awesome! Perfect little game to kill some time with and the ads aren't really all that bad or obnoxious as other apps. In fact there are rewards for watching some of the ads sometimes! Very funny and silly theme as well! Love the progression too! \u263a. Best game ever. Super entertaining! I love that it's not only a game to see how many points you get but it has missions, the little Birds that you can buy, the hats, it's all super interactive. Definitely the only app that keeps me on my phone \ud83d\ude05. Just absolutely love this game! I used to play this 2 years ago I guess. The themes of zombies and every little detail in the game is just amazing to observe as an artistic point of view. The sound effects, graphics according to the game's theme, algorithms within the game (for ex - falling sound effect when zombies count goes down), different interesting names of the tubes that we have to collect, upgrades and added upgrades are fun, along with the daily missions! It's a really addicting game!. I like this game because it has funny looking zombies and funny looking people i also like the beach scene from it and the cat calling for help, poor cat ;( and the designs of the cars, tanks, 2 story bus and a AIRPLANE!?! also the quests you have to do everyday then earn diamonds is bussin i cant remember if there were updates during the years, also i wish you had a great day cya!. Mobile gaming is interesting. Mobile games before 2014 in particular, like this and Battle Cats tend to lack a lot of scummy practices mobile gaming has been known to have now, and that lack is great on its own. Those older era games do tend to succumb a bit (e.g. My Singing Monsters) but for the most part they don't end up including them eithe, now that's really great.. This game that will make you install it over and over again because its really casual yet adventurous and fun. Although, you will be angry a little bit because of some weekly challenges and so hard just to get the big prize, it still make you want to play more. Fun, really.. Well the gameplay is super entertaining and the graphics are amazing! I appreciate the new things you added like the daily/weekly challenges and the extra boost on Wednesdays! The only complaint I have is the U.F.O. It screws up the jumps when it's cloning a zombie, and this is extremely frustrating... could maybe consider replacing that bonus with like zombie soldiers that shoot grenade launchers? THAT would be so cool \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude01. AWESOME GAME! This is the best \"side scroller,\" that there is! Simple, yet clean graphics, smooth game play, and best of all, PURCHASES ARE NOT NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE TOP LEVELS! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. This is a great way to burn up a few spare \"minutes\"and, an internet connection is not necessary to play (though certain bonuses become unavailable). This game is actually really charming. The last time I played was about 4 or 5 years ago, but I recently started playing again. I always played on my mom's phone while we were traveling, so I never got to hear the music. But I wish I did because this whole game makes me smile, especially with the sound on!. Fantastic game. Lots of missions and upgrades. Dress up your zombies with hats! Very cute. I just hope there are more levels and upgrades coming!. I have every zombird, I got over 10.000 diamonds, and over 1 million coins. Please add some more challenges\ud83d\ude4f. This game is so relaxing and fun! Just a simple game that i would recommend for kids, especially when i was 4 or 5 years old just before i knew it i really loved this so much! And now im 9-years old and still loving it! Keep on the Amazing work!. I love this game! It's amusing to collect as many zombies as I can and then watch the little sh!ts get killed off! It's fun, runs well, and doesn't try to suck money out of me. There are ads but you can pay to remove them.. Wonderful game it is fun \ud83d\udc4d I've been playing it for probably about 9 years I enjoy it very much it's changed a lot. I recommend this game for anyone that gets bored. Thank you for the game.", "neg_reviews": "the ads have ruined this game. you cant even get out of some of them. some don't have a timer or an x so you are stuck there on the ad or have to force close the app and reopen it to get the ad off your screen. this is ridiculous and this game should be pulled from the store until they remove the ads. Update: the devoloper has.done nothing to remove the ads that \"Rick roll\" you. Please remove this app from the play store until the developer removed these intrusive ads that hijack your device.. I love this game. I've played it for yrs. All the ads are making the game freeze & crash for the past month and it hasn't been fixed yet. Just played a few minutes ago and add still freeze on the screen, can't back out or exit. This is a terrible bug/tech issue that needs to be fixed. The new updates are rubbish. The bird fusion sucks and is confusing and the 15 second ads after each round is just rude and aggressive.. Gets boring REALLY fast.... Of course way to many ads. Game is totally rigged. Play it long enough and you will know what I mean. I understand the purpose of the app is to make money for the developers. But come on, nothing ever changes in the game. The bonuses that you purchase in the game give about .001 percent help. I no longer like this game... I hate it.. When you unlocked Rabbi's hat, it has a description \"why not? after all, Jesus was a zombie\" You're giving us something we don't have to explain with the kids. You know what to do, please.. new fusion is a joke!!, what are you guys doing?. I was really enjoying the game until you did this, ridiculous update. have you any idea how long it takes to get double zombirds!!, if not changed Back I will uninstall. so now we have to get double the amount to fuse!!, have you any idea how long that takes?!!!. you are just after our cash, absolutely rubbish \ud83d\ude23. for days now I have not been able to get any kind of free diamonds by watching ads or logging in. I tried resetting the app and nothing happens. When I click on the cinema pass it says that there's no internet connection but clearly there is because when I click on purchase something it takes me right to where I need to be. until this is fixed or addressed , I won't be updating my rating.. the controls on this game is impossible too even play and most of the time when i watch advertisements just too get diamonds i cant seemed too get any diamonds just for watching advertisements its been disabled and the game design glitches out and then breakdown were at the point that i barely get any cash or diamonds on this game at all this game design has failed. It's okay Frustrating gameplay with how many \"random\" zombie losses occur. Cars n bombs become pointless to jump. Very repetitive game play, annoying how the camera zooms in more as game progresses when coupled with above points. Gets boring fast.. Ads have ruined the experience. No way to cancel the ads. They keep playing for 20-30 seconds every damn time.. Used to love playing this game & it never had ads. After downloading it again for such a long time I noticed there was a buy no ads section in the corner which I went to immediately & tried buying it but every single time I try buying it my transaction gets declined. I try enjoying the game but literally every single time I die there's an ad. So annoying considering I can't even buy it without ads since they're so cheap that the transaction doesn't even work. Used to be fun. Not recommended.. I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.. I unstalled this game because I was about to win in a weekend challenge but the game glitched and made me jump for no reason and that made me lost this game is really rigged dont play this game if you rage a lot actually no one should for these glitches and this is not the first time it happened to me this game sucks ass. This used to be one of my favorite games some years ago. Now, it's just another full of ads game. 1 minute of game for 1 minute of ads. Not even an option to buy an ad free version. Sorry, but I don't care about shity ads. I wanna play the game. And since I have no choice of doing so without getting an ad after every game, it's 1 star for me. Ads destroying the games.. no diamonds after the videos. it won't let me play after watching ads to resurrect the zombies. it's stuck on a purple screen. my game info did not transfer to my new phone. app developer does not respond to users' reviews and comments.. I've played this game for at least 3 years.I've always loved it. I didn't like it when you took away the tsunami wave, but eventually it sort of came back.... But now I'm Uninstalling... Whatever you've done recently is horrendous. I can't jump across any gaps, even getting over a small car is nearly impossible now. It's unplayable.. I've kept & played (& replayed) this game for years, I loved it. But for the last few weeks the sensitivity while jumping has just disappeared. It's gone very slow to jump at my touch, which after all is the whole point of the game is it not? It has also been crashing when trying to get diamonds from watching 5 videos. This game has never crashed AT ALL before! Please fix mobigame. Thank you. This game is not that bad no I take it back it is bad. Some times this game gives me coins and diamonds even though I didn't do a thing or two. Look the point is I want this game to be more efficient and More challenging. Like This game should be Cheat Proof.. Good game but the very rare and ultra rare eggs are way toooo rare. I'm level 111 and I've never seen one. Very unrewarding. Also the blue and red pill should move. Always accidentally press that dumb button when it pops up. Scummy game design.. Game was entertaining enough to ignore the blatant money grab before the latest update, but since then it has become very clear that there's nothing more to it anymore. From the Zombird Fusion update that tripled the amount of work (and diamonds, oh boy, what a coincidence!), to the adds that freeze the app midgame after using ressurection for example, dont expect the latest wave of players to stick around for too long and keep engorging your pockets.", "pos": "Negative reviews summary:\n- Game controls are not good, leading to frustration when losing at crucial moments.\n- Some offers in the in-game store could be improved.\n- UFO bonus can be frustrating as it interferes with jumps.\n- Some weekly challenges are perceived as too hard to achieve big prizes.\n- Wish for faster upgrades and ability to buy locked items with coins.\n- A few complaints about ads, although they are generally tolerable compared to other games.\n- Requests for more challenges, levels, and upgrades to be added in the future.\n- Suggestions to replace certain bonuses with more enjoyable features, like zombie soldiers shooting grenade launchers.", "neg": "Players are overwhelmingly frustrated by the intrusive and disruptive ads in Zombie Tsunami.

I've played racing game before, but they usually make you wait for energy to race or whatnot. The graphics are very nice but not quite as sleek as they could be. The controls are good, I use them with tilt steering (accelerometer). However, there is no way to reverse, and I'm still waiting for the game that allows you to manually shift in something other than a drag race. Nonetheless, it is a lot of fun to play, allows for some nice customization, and is much better designed than other games I've tried.. Firstly, thanks to eden games for sitting and investing their time to think once about the car enthusiasts from all over the world. No doubt it's something more than the adrenaline rush. Beautiful environment, competitive races, thousands of variations in cars. Indeed it is forza horizon for mobiles. I am very happy to see the interactive garage and customizations which you guys brought in the game. So, thanks a lot. Probably I am loving it over NFS. \ud83d\ude1c. I have only been playing this game for a few hours, but I am completely consumed by it. The graphics, the game setup, and the complete fun this game provides is awesome. I would give it five stars, and in the future I still might, after I put it to the test of playing it for at least a week. For now this game beats all others I have played including Real Racing 3. To the people who built this game awesome job I give you a big thumbs up. No I am going to give you five stars now exceptional game!!. I like this game. The graphics are really nice but there is something weird happening with I first load into the tutorial, the sky turned PINK. Is this a glitch or it is meant to happen?? But overall it is a really good game, almost as good as Real Racing 3. And also, Rewind feature always a win. More racing games should have this feature.. Well, so far I have only been playing for a couple of hours, but I think the game it's beautifully made. You get to drive through long races, customize your garage AND cars and it has some really good graphics. Hopefully they won't go over the top with updates and pay to win content. Keep it simple, and you'll eventually take over those other Android driving games.. This game is high quality throughout. Not only are there a variety of racing styles, surfaces, and more...The graphics are also at the highest standard. This is not an \"arcade\" or \"Asphalt\" style racer. Much more sophisticated and custom for each player. You are able to build your own garage and cars. Some of the customizations are the first I've experienced in an Android app. This is an EXCELLENT game that can continue to grow and mature. Looking forward to the next release too.. Easily one of the best racing games on mobile. Once you fine tune the controls and assists, the game feels great to play. Tons of customization, lots of real world cars, upgrades, and a massive amount of tracks and content. The garage mechanic is a lot of fun and gives longevity to the game. The cars are a bit pricey, as is the premium currency, but you definitely get a lot for your money. Also supports high FPS and supports 90hz for you other OnePlus 7 Pro owners like me! ;p Loving this game!. Fun as fq. Pretty decent option to Asphalt 8. Asphalt 8 is the funnest game for android hands down. Nothing has come remotely close to touching the rate of fun that is in that game. Its took 3 yrs, unfortunately, I'm just burned out on it. I know evey corner, every jump, every nitro, in the game. Great fq'n game. Tremendous job by the creators and the development team. You guys are fantastic. You made that game for us to play and I enjoyed every single second of it. Even when I lost the race.. Only one of its kind! First one maybe..... Simply awesome and addictive... The physics feels superb... Just bring the Cockpit Cam and few more locations and nothing can put you guys down! One more thing is that you can bring another mode for professional drivers and make it a bit harder...... Amazing work by the developers... Cheers\ud83c\udf7b!. Easily the best game on Google play. Manual shifting of gears would be a great addition(I know it could make the screen look clunky, but some of us really don't mind it.) I'll be playing further and should the game hold to the promise of the initial stage, I probably might even spend cash on this. Will update this review after further play through. I love this game coz it has so good details, visual and sound is also good. There is no other game that gives this much experience in my lower device. I recommend this game to all of my friends. You don't need to pay money like other other games which ask money for better cars or upgrades, that's what I like the most about this game.. Its a great game I've played, I hope for your next update, will you add an Iconic Lamborghini Cars such as Aventador, Sesto Elemento, Huracan, etc., Ferrari Cars such as Laferrari, FXXK, FXXK Evo, Enzo, F50, F40, etc. Ford Cars like Ford GT 2017 and many more Cars, Thank you and more power.. Hands Down one of the best Racing/Car games on mobile. I have play all kinds of racing games and this one still takes my breathe away. The tracks are amazing..... honestly Dev's KUDOS ! ! ! I can't say enough good things about this game. The one thing I do not enjoy is taking my muscle car out on the Rally tracks. Lol still fun !. Great game play and like the graphics and controls. But why does the game not fully load some of the \"Flash Events\". This is happening regular. When you press on the Flash Event there's no picture of the car that you'd be using in the Flash Event then it doesn't load. So when you go out of the Flash Event then go back in it never loads further than 95% so you have to wait until the next Flash Event and hope it loads. Can you you please help me with this problem or fix it.. Absolutely amazingly gorgeous game. Keeps you plugged for days on end , and I never seem to get enough. It just gets better and better the more you play. I love this. Also love the fact that it's so well done , detailed , and has real cars and brands! Though I do wish I could have both brake and acceleration pedal , and the steering buttons in the same control setup. Or maybe add custom game controls , and maybe who knows , engine tuning , turbo kits and internals , exhausts , engine swaps etc!. This game is great, great choice for those who crazy about time setter. But mostly item in this game rely on Gold and expensive. Maybe you guys can do some Limited-Time sales and worth a grind such a big rewards. Overall, lot of changes from the first release and it is wonderful. This game is a successor of the Test Drive from same developer.. Works great with amazon tablets, but not so much with fusion5 104w tablets... Frequently lags, and force closes far more frequently than NFS no limits. We need the option of logging out to switch accounts to play on different save files to avoid reinstalling the app to do so.. This game is definitely one of the best I've seen. Good graphics, Nicely realistic physics, Quite some freedom regarding Controls and assists, Cheap Customization options and good difficulty. One thing i could see being improved is AI Awareness, so that they avoid hitting the player and slowing themselves down. 19/20 would reccomend. I wasn't sure whether it was worth 1.28 GB , the tutorial was good but it kept goi g for more races and I couldnt even visit my performance shop. I thought it was a bust but, after the tutorial it was great.I visit my performance shop anytime, participte in races. The concepts are really good specially the car dealership concept I like it very much. I would love it more If you coud open the trunk of the car too with the bonnet and the door. Overall one of the best racing games I've ever played.. This game is definitely one of the best I've seen.

Developers should've given a manual setting change option but instead we're advice to reach the help website. The developers seem to be doing nothing about it! I reached the help website and they say, currently it's an issue with Xiaomi users. Save your data on Facebook and use another device to play. That's a really careless answer. 'Cuz, I posted this problem months ago and nothing's changed since. Highly disappointed.. Totally appalling experience. Used to be one of the best games in racing genre, but by forcing the use of a gamepad the game does not respond to gyro controls. The developers should understand that this is still a mobile game and not a console or pc game. Not everyone carries a gamepad to play games on their phones.. Graphics are good. Controls are bit unresponsive sometimes. The tracks are a bit tough to learn for beginners. The cars are nice. The game gives a little bit feeling of forza on andorid. However, progressing further is very hard. Earning golds are money isn't that easy, the races give very small payout but cars are very expensive. The controls of this game are also trash. The rating is decreases because this game is lagging like hell when competing for time trial races.. My review was removed. Game is rigged after unlocking B zones. Race will start and you'll fall into the sea with no race track available and you'll have to service your car again. Stearing gives in while racing. You'll be unable to turn and just drive straight or vise versa, forcing you to give up. Other drivers on the track only drive into you and race away, forcing you to give up. Why? It's a good game and users will make purchases later on. Why rig it and force us to stop playing?. Normal game. Graphics are good. But turning system of cars is very bad. But afterwards this game becomes way too boring. We can't purchase car. When we will comeplete many events then only we can purchase. The money we get from races is very low and the prices for buying cars is very high. Everything in this game needs money. ( Game money ). This is not true racing. It's just Bore Racing. Rally race system is very worst. Can't drift cars properly. Very bad. Remove this game from playstore.Worst. This is one of the game with worst controls. They don't provide the option of customizing the control system, for people who'd like to get more gaming experience. This is a great game for starters and people who play for fun. But this is not the kind of game you should go for if you like driving and play a game just so you can drive.. Yes, the game matches the description as it's said here, but I'm a racer and I can tell that this game was most likely made for certain people, money spenders. At worst, from C class, getting cash or gold for upgrades or even cars, is like taking a cup of water from the ocean to fill up a swimming pool, and so as a f2p, that's your brick wall. Customizing cars with gold is impossible, Getting gold is insane hard once u reach B class! Guys, Make an option for f2p players to grow too!! \ud83d\ude24. This absolutely infuriates me, I loved this game, one of the best racing games I've ever played on a mobile device but now i can't play if because it has a forced game pad. so disappointing, please fix this. Issue of showing the controller controls on the screen and cannot play. Even with the controller connected it won't work. My mobile is redmi note 8 pro. I saw another person with the same phone, same issue. It would be great if you can fix this. I really liked this game and I'm really disappointed. This game is awesome but why we have to connect Internet all time. I will suggest that it will be so great if we can play it offline any time, only the multiplayer or event should requires Internet connection i am so uhappy because this game have no open world career mode and we cannot even start the game without Internet connection, likewise i like the graphics of this game. I hope you will make the game, playable offline too... All marvelous: Brilliant maps, brilliant graphics, brilliant game play and not massively pay-to-win. The online is fun - but I wish there was a way you could play it without an internet connection. Bad: Very very buggy. For some reason my Dodge charger R/T Scat Pack has some weird texturing issue when in the garage. When I moved it to the garage I could no longer interact with it and it's now stuck there.. By far the best racing game on android. Love the progression rate and 3d interactive map. Its also really nice that you can make your garage your own and open up hood of car etc. Lots of custimization and realistic controls i would like a cockpit view tho however and an optoon to use a steering wheel with manual controls only tilt atm. However main glitch for me is I did a flash even and right after theres a tutorial telling me to check rarity of flash event but since I did it its grayed out and when I click it I cant click anything else game is in a stucl loop. Plz fix devs great game but unable to progress atm.. Extremely first impression gone very wrong. I installed this game 2 times and always showing on startup (A connection with the server cannot be established. Please disable airplane mode or enable wifi) even my internet connection running normal and fast. 1.2 Gb game setup download in 2 minutes and after install showing (server cannot be established). How can i play tell me if there any solution.. This game is suck due to the reason that some reward I have gained but the system don't count it and this situation always occur. Besides, some of the flash event is fake, because the car doesn't even have in the game you can't play the flash event, you will always stuck in the loading. Furthermore,at the beginning you will feel easy but until you play in the middle you will realised you even get all star in every race but you can afford C and D class car so you need always wait the falsh event.. Very bad gameplay :( Instead of player playing the game, the game is playing with player. Even fully upgraded still can't win, until the game decide to let you. Once you race an event, there's no same awards the second time you enter. Play and forgot, so no interest to collect cars and play again and again. One star for the stunning visuals, and one for the only one worthy to play future - the flash events.. Why isn't the game launching... It is stuck at 95% for last 1 hour. Tried many times to launch this app. I am using high speed wifi.. I don't know You This game was added to Android play store.. Il agree graphics are Top notch but how can we play when Android smart phones users don't use Controler.?? Theirs no way to control ur vehicle, no motion movement nor tap movement.. U need a Ps controler to play this game.. I'm so disappointed when I downloaded and uninstalled right after playing.. The game recognizes the gyro but it is not configured correctly, it uses wrong axis for steering, I tried contacting customer support but no response. I cant give the game better rating since it is unplayable for me. EDIT: I tried paying again, and managed to play three races just fine but on the fourth race controls began to malfunction again.. Cannot connect to server even with a stable internet connection. Device: Oneplus 8 Android 10 Edit: it's been 10 days, have sent support too but no revert. Edit: customer service is pathetic. So many people got same issue but still they don't even care to read. Edit: even after the latest update the problem persists. I give up. the tutorial is disgusting: long and entirely useless with no option to skip it and it glitched twice already in a way that the game is still running but it doesn't let me do anything, no buttons or actions work at all. Another game that looked alright but they destroyed it with a tutorial, when will they finally learn to add a damn SKIP TUTORIAL button?... uninstalled.", "pos": "Negative reviews summarize:\n- Players appreciate the realistic driving experience and variety of cars to collect, upgrade, and customize.\n- Many enjoy the graphics and the interactive garage feature.\n- Some users mention the game is better designed compared to other racing games they've tried.\n- The rewind feature is appreciated.\n- The game is praised for its customization options and the ability to build your own garage.\n- Some users mention the game is high quality and not like typical arcade racers.\n- The controls are good, with multiple control schemes supported.\n- Some users find the game addictive and fun to play.\n- The game provides a lot of content with a wide range of tracks and cars.", "neg": "Negative reviews summary:\n1.

It doesn't force any ads at you or force you to watch ads so i don't know what you one star reviewers talking about but you need to stop hating on a game that just came out and they're still updating it. Overall a good tycoon and I love the graphics and the people and the machines look really good. Thank you for this awesome game!. Absolutely amazing game, ads are completely optional but are worth taking, i have never once been bored. Normally i dread the prestige function but in this game its simply cool to see a new island and you dont have to spend much time getting to where you were. Every upgrade is obtainable and quests guide you in the right direction. Super excited for more updates and a new game! For your next game i would really like to see a auto dealership tycoon amd you start with a low value \"fake\" brand and. Awesome game. Would love to see a smoothie & protein shake bar with salads. Nutrition is the twin of exercise; it is hard to be your healthiest self without both. Also, some diets are ridiculous, hilarious, & subject to being a fad just like anything else. Would also love to see tug of war, water sports (swimming, polo, diving, synchronized swimming & diving), basketball, gymnastics, wrestling, etc. included in the Summer Season. Tennis is needed year-round. Its off-season is ~1 month.. I picked to rate this game 5 stars because in my opinion it is super addictive with all the different upgrades and upgrading to new gyms. It also helps with the man in yellow with bonus money or diamonds. If you want more money you can buy them with the diamonds when you finish your quests and gain them. Best game I've ever played! Love it so much!. I've downloaded a few games while on YouTube but almost all of them I uninstall before before the end of the day. I was really only intrigued enough to download it because I liked the idea of a fitness based idle tycoon, but I wasn't expecting much. But this game is actually quite enjoyable. I can see the effort, creativity, and love they put in this game. If you're a fan of idle games this is one you should give a try, you might be pleasantly surprised by how much fun it is.. Been playing for about 5mins now. The game seems pretty fun and legit. Easy to level up, at least for now. Obviously leveling will get harder as I progress in the game. We'll see how long I stay entertained.. I really enjoy this game. I don't have a massive amount of time to play phone games so checking in ever few hours, upgrading some stuff, then putting away my phone is perfect for me. My only criticism is that I wish there were more of the competitions and more often. If they happened every 12 hours, and you didn't have to wait 24 hours for the competition to become available it would be great.. Overall good game. It has a Long tutorial, and it's a slow paced game but its pretty good. I especially like that the advertisements are a choice, rather than forced, you don't see many games like that.. Still waiting for an update. They pump out new games super quick but dont add new maps to the old games, it's really annoying. It's not worth spending any money on their games since you can only use the benefit for a very short time. Need an update please!!! Great time killer, I bought the no ads pack, well worth it. I wish they had that option in all their games.. I just started this game so not much to judge but from what I can see this will be my favourite time pass game. The game is quiet interesting in keeping the player engaged with the gym, and ya there are ads but they are optional and can provide amazing rewards if you plan to watch them. In all the graphics, gamplay is nice if you are thinking of playing then I say definitely give it a try its eye catching for sure.. The game is entertaining and easy to understand. Also a good game to kill some time. Codigames always makes good tycoon games, really looking forward to what they have next in store.. this game is actually really good, like you might leave for a couple days because moneys being slow but its really fun imo, great gaphics, you dont have to watch adds 24/7 unless you want too plus they have different icons when u upgrade the equipment. (coming from someone with a chromebook it might be different on your device i have no clue tho). Let me start with the ads. Yes, there are a lot of ads (most of which are optional). But the developers gotta make money somehow. Besides, the ads are extremely short. I'm talking less than 30 seconds can make you $10,000,000 in this game. I really like the way this game placed and used its ads. The game itself is a good time-killer and is overall really good. I highly recommend this tycoon. The only thing that could make this better is having more than 3 missions at a time. Maybe 5? Great game!. The game is good but the problem is how much some things cost. If they made things cheaper or easier to get money it be much better. Despite this still a great game recomend a lot.. This game is Spectacular. If your a big fan of tycoon games this game is perfect for you!You can upgrade your Gym so that it is bigger and you can add in different exercising equipment. You can also earn money pretty fast so you don't have to wait. The game also let's you unlock athletes which then you can train and the athletes train the visitors which come to your gym. THIS GAME DEFINITELY DESERVES A 5 STAR RATING! All you need to do is click the install button and play it's that easy go on!. These game is super cool game because I have 5 machines and upgrading them and I have a lot of customers and I had a lot locker doors and iupgrade it and it doesn't as any glitches I like the game.. this is one of my favorite games you can play inside your house because you can't really go outside because of the coronavirus so enjoy the game it's the best hope you enjoy my comment and the game the game mostly so yeah that's my comments hopefully this helps the game because I don't want the game to go out of business I don't know what I just said that is a really good game yeah so go play the game Idaho fitness gym ticon play it best game in the whole entire world let's do this we rock \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa. I am literally addicted to this game, I can play it for hours and won't notice,but after a bit it starts to get a little grindy but I don't mind, I recommend this game to any idle game lover so I give this 5 stars. I love all these tycoon games by this game designer of course. I wouldn't spend real money on any other game. These are awesome games to play very relaxing and enjoyable also very addictive. Hours would go by without you even knowing. Keep up the awesome work.. Best tycoon app on the App Store. I'm about 5 minutes in, and this game actually makes you feel in control of your business. If you like playing these types of games, then you'll know that some just don't feel \"right\" This game hits the spot like no other app has been able to ever since I started playing mobile games back in 2012. Kudos to the team", "neg_reviews": "In the beginning it's fun, but not to long into the game you have to watch ad after ad to make money to upgrade machines or add on. Also the money system is rediculous; for example, my customers in the game are currently paying 30 BILLION dollars to get into the gym. I gave two stars because it was entertaining for several days, but it becomes mind numbingly boring, and even with wathing all the ads, you don't make enough to upgrade.. Repetitive, boring, mindlessly wait for money to build, so you can buy a treadmill to mindlessly wait for another treadmill....you have to wait for 10,000 dollars to unlock a new room...or watch ad after ad for 2 gems. They give a unneeded tutorial for a basic, boring game that you dont need for a basic click and add game. Video games are suppose to be a fun break from reality not a just timed advertisment. Theres no challenge besides not killing yourself while waiting.. This game is sort of fun at first but quickly becomes \"Idle Ad Tycoon\". Virtually everything you do kicks off a 30 second ad and it's basically a requirement to accomplish anything with much speed. You can disable them for $11 but I cant justify spending that kind of money just to experience the game in its default form. Purchases should enhance your experience not be a requirement.. It was ok at first it gave you a run through of the game.then all hell broke lose it took me an hour yes an hour to get 1 of the items so yeah i deleted it because it was horrible if you wanted to get enough money to get enyone of the items you would have to buy it it was 1 of the worst games i have ever played. I've now noticed with several of CodiGames games, that after a few days of play, the progression pretty much halts completely unless you spend cash, even watching ads no longer helps you progress (which of course they get money for). Only 2 stars as first few days were enjoyable, I'd have watched plenty ads to progress but no point anymore.. Severe lack of content. You will quickly hit the progression cap and the game has been abandoned. Zero content updates for months now. Very disappointing considering how easy making a new gym level would be. Don't waste your time, especially don't waste your money. The developers are clearly not interested in supporting this game anymore. I'll change my review if the developers decide to start making content for their games, not just making as many games as possible for money.. I maxed the game out three month ago and haven't been able to update or reset my \"gym\" since then. Once you reach the final gym there is no reason to keep playing. Very dissatisfied and disappointed that I paid to skip all the ads. I only played it for about a month before i reached the end. Held on for updates and nothing new has come out. Such a waste of money and time.. No update since earlier this year pls update the game. It's so hard to level up right now. The game is enjoyable until you unlock the last gym and finish all the missions. Then you simply are logging on to collect offline income and train your elites...which gets incredibly boring. Please update and make another expansion available, maybe even include some sort of round robin mission system or something where you can basically \"new game +\" the entire gym; retaining purchases and making exponentially more money as you go forward over and over again. No in-gamecontinuity otherwise.... My review was deleted so I'm writing it again. The ridiculously long, unskippable tutorials are ridiculous and make playing this game, and most others from this company intolerable. We've all played tycoons, have some respect for your player base, obviously we don't NEED a 6 minute tutorial saying \"buy stuff and make money\" Long tutorials that can't be skipped are the death of casual mobile gaming in cases like this.. You don't have to watch the ads but they throw so many at you it's obnoxious. You can just watch ad after ad after ad if you wanted. I get that ads are part of the monetization but this is too much. Also by gym 3 you'll hit a money wall where you pretty much have to spam ads to make a difference.. Used to play this game all the time, but haven't been able to even open it in months. The game opens to the loading screen, the bar mostly fills up, then it closes. I've tried reporting it multiple times but no one has responded. I wouldn't care so much but I've spent actual money in this game and now I can't even access it.. This game is so good and very enjoyable but when you renovate your gym all the machines and gym accessories disappears and you goes to the starting of the game and our profit is not so much in this renovation.The game is so good but this step of renovation is not this step of renovation makes game poor thanks.. Spent a lot of money on 3 of their games and wish I hadn't. There is very little to do and then they end and are pointless because the replay value is 0. The amount spent is way beyond what you get. I never play phone games but tried these games and now it's taught me to never do it again. Seriously don't bother. If you don't pay you'll have to watch ads 90% of the time, but if you pay you don't get much in return for high prices.. Boring. Like most of the \"idle\" games, the further you progress the less time you spend playing the game. I stay away for 8 hours then come back and make 3 changes before my money runs out, then it's another 8 hour wait before I can do anything else. Idle games are not a challenge in skill or technique, they're a challenge in patience.. The idea of the game is solid, but the only way to make sufficient money is to continuously watch ads or pay them $11 for a gym manager. Also, why the insane money amounts? The money structure made it difficult to understand the actual costs of anything.. Well this game gets boring. The upgrades get way way expensive n you can't put it down n hope it builds money for you like idle games should. Yes it gives u the option to watch an ad to double ur idled gatherings but its not much cuz ur gym stops workin pretty fast when ur off. Its geared heavily on u havin to watch ads a lot to get anywhere but you still don't get there very fast. I have tried to get up too a certain amount for 3 days n even with ads i can't get there..Don't waste ur time.. Basically a good game but to progress you need ridiculous amounts of credit (trillions, quintillion and more) just to add a treadmill or spinning cycle (and don't even think of building another room). To build more rooms you have to renovate the gym and the start from scratch again, And while you gain credit there is nothing to do but watch. Not exactly entertaining. Gets boring after a few days.. EDIT: no gym updates since 27/04/20 (11 months current), dead game Started playing and a week l8r I was already at max gym level... purchase prices for every upgrade are stupidly high and this includes removing ads etc. I'm okay spending $4 but not $20 ($50 if you want all the normal bonuses) change it to $15 max. I have to level equipment up 500 levels in order for it to give me current level money, but the cost exponentially increases. I can't afford anything now at max gym. Good progression at first but when you get too the next gym progression is way too slow. Without buying dumping money into upgrades youll get nothing done. This game has a pay option too buy a manger for $10 too not play the game. Let me repeat that, you pay $10 too not play the game. The amount of greed these games have on the app store is insane. Sadly people buy these upgrades and make the games worst and worst over the years. One star.", "pos": "Players love Idle Fitness Gym Tycoon for its **addictive gameplay**, **optional ads**, and **smooth progression system**. They praise the **high-quality graphics**, particularly noting the detailed design of the **gym equipment, people, and machines**. The game's **prestige function** is well-received, offering a refreshing take on the mechanic with new islands and minimal time investment. Users appreciate the **clear guidance provided by quests** and the **attainable nature of upgrades**. The **variety of gym equipment and fitness activities** is a major draw, with suggestions for even more options like a smoothie bar and additional sports. The game's **idle nature** is perfect for players with limited time, allowing them to check in, upgrade, and earn rewards easily. The **optional ad format** is highly commended, providing a fair and rewarding experience. \n", "neg": "Players express frustration with the game's heavy reliance on ads for progression.  The cost of upgrades, particularly for gym equipment and new rooms, becomes prohibitively expensive, forcing players to either endure constant ads or spend real money. The game's money system is also criticized for its unrealistic inflation, with customers paying exorbitant amounts.  Many find the gameplay repetitive and boring, with long wait times for upgrades and a lack of engaging content. The tutorial is considered unnecessarily long and the progression system is seen as flawed, with players hitting a wall unless they spend money. The lack of updates and new content, despite the potential for expanding gym levels and features, is a major complaint. \n", "summary": "-", "features": "-", "adjectives": "-", "search_term": "-"}, "jp.ne.ibis.ibispaintx.app": {"app_name": "ibis Paint X", "description": "ibis Paint X is a popular and versatile drawing app downloaded more than 200 million times in total as a series, which provides over 7100 brushes, over 2800 materials, over 900 fonts, 79 filters, 46 screentones, 27 blending modes, recording drawing processes, stroke stabilization feature, various ruler features such as radial line rulers or symmetry rulers, and clipping mask features.\n\n*YouTube channel\nMany tutorial videos on ibis Paint are uploaded to our YouTube channel.\nSubscribe it!\nhttps://youtube.com/ibisPaint\n\n*Concept/Features\n- A Highly functional and professional features surpassing that of desktop drawing apps.\n- Smooth and comfortable drawing experience realized by OpenGL technology.\n- Recording your drawing process as a video.\n- SNS feature where you can learn drawing techniques from other users' drawing process videos.\n\n*Features\nibis Paint has high functionality as a drawing app along with features of sharing drawing processes with other users.\n\n[Brush Features]\n- Smooth drawing at up to 60 fps.\n- Over 7100 kinds of brushes including dip pens, felt tip pens, digital pens, air brushes, fan brushes, flat brushes, pencils, oil brushes, charcoal brushes, crayons and stamps.\n- Various brush parameters such as starting/ending thickness, starting/ending opacity, and initial/final brush angle.\n- Quick sliders that allow you to quickly adjust brush thickness and opacity.\n- Real time brush previews.\n\n[Layer Features]\n- You can add layers as many as you need with no limit.\n- Layer parameters that can be set to each layers individually such as layer opacity, alpha blending, adding, subtracting, and multiplying.\n- A handy clipping feature for clipping images, etc.\n- Various layer commands such as layer duplication, import from the photo library, horizontal inversion, vertical inversion, layer rotation, layer moving, and zooming in/out.\n- A feature for setting layer names to distinguish different layers.\n\n*About ibis Paint purchase plan\nThe following purchase plans are available for ibis Paint:\n- ibis Paint X (free version)\n- ibis Paint (paid version)\n- Remove Ads Add-on\n- Prime Membership (Monthly plan / Yearly plan)\nThere is no difference in features other than the presence or absence of advertisements for the paid version and the free version.\nIf you purchase the Remove Ads Add-on, the ads will not be displayed and there will be no difference from the paid version of ibis Paint.\nIn order to use more advanced functions, the following Prime Membership (Monthly plan / Yearly plan) contracts are required.\n\n[Prime Membership]\nA prime member can use the prime features.

A bit of a problem is whenever I make an artwork that has too many layers, I was forced out of the app, this happened to me quite sometimes. Though, it's still a great app, it also have a few tutorials that will help you as a beginner, totally recommend downloading.. It's a really good app and 100% recommended for digital artists... But still, I don't know if it's only my problem... But the app doesn't let me work for long hours. I had to delete my 13 hour piece because it keeps glitching. It successfully did let me work for below 10 hours though... But it's a very, very good app! 5 stars!. I have nothing but to give this app 5 stars! This app is one of the best drawing apps out there. This app has alot of tools and amazing features that are necessary for digital drawing. It's amazing on how u can create a custom brush and share it with others. There's also online pictures u can add in the app itself! It's truly wonderful and such a appreciatable app that was clearly made with a lot of love and dedication for the people who use it. Thank you for making this app!. This is a very good app! I can improvise in drawing with this app! However,i couldn't share my drawings because i should not and can not know how to. You can learn the functionalities of this app by using it a lot. Thank you for this app! Very convenient! (Also,my question is: How many Japanese people use this app? If you can't answer,it's okay.). I have been using this app for about 3 or more years and its amazing \ud83d\udc4f.. Like it has all the basic things + if you need the premium brushes then you can just watch the video \ud83d\udcf9 and yeah boom available for 18 hrs and there's a lot of features that you can try and experiment with over all I am in love \ud83e\udd70 with this app. My first choice in digital painting on a mobile device, an app that is just well-made. I hope you people could increase the canvas size, especially when I finally decided to pay for ads to be gone and the website says that the canvas will be bigger. The only thing that got bigger was the field of view, since banner ads are removed. Still hoping to atleast paint on a 6k or even an 8k resolution canvas. Make it happen, I know it's not that hard to upgrade that option.. I love this app sm, I use this app so much. Super easy to use aswell, definitely would recommend for new digital artists! Some digital artists make me inspire from they're drawings using ibispaint. They also added in something where you can use poses (love this feature)!! I don't have to go to Google and try to find refrence photos for my drawing. BUT PLEASE ADD MORE POSES, I NEED MOREEE. EDIT! Ads are appearing lesser, which makes me glad that they do hear us out. A bit laggy sometimes but not as much as before !! \ud83d\ude04 A very great update. Though when I save the drawing in my album, it'll appear to be a bit pixelated or low quality? I'm asking if there's any way to improve the quality to be high and not a bit pixelated, Overall, it's alright. A few ups and downs but it still functions the way it is described, :) glad sticking to this app for years now!. It's really good for beginners in digital art. This is the only digital art platform I've used and it's worked really well. Super easy to get the hang of, plus it's free! You can watch adds to get extra brushes and stuff for 13 hours. You get one add when you leave your picture, and they have a small add playing at the top while you draw, but I hardly notice it.. Easy to use and lots of features and options. It took me only about an hour to get familiar with the user interface and start creating my custom sigil art, thanks to the terrific tutorial pop-ups s you use the app. I've already saved several custom sigils I needed to create. And I saved custom palettes of my favorite brushes and colors for quick access in the future, as well. So glad I found this program! This is going to be a game changer.. So far better than Adobe both price and functionality the ads are irritated but I paid for this application and since it's a one time payment. No monthly fees. So far, worth the price. I couldn't be happier and I'm looking forward to seeing this app advanced into better future features. Thank you ibis team for giving artists a chance on going digital. <3. Even though its pretty simple I love it! I went to a little beginner and now I'm drawing high level drawing like anime! Thanks so much this is the best drawing app and it's really simple little kids can use it too! The best thing is you don't even have to pay for for stuff you already have everything you need to play with! End of story. BEST APP EVERRRR!!. I think this a great app overall, the adverts are well placed and the tools are easy to access and not confusing. The amount of brushes are insane. I would recommend this app for anyone looking into digital art! One thing I would ask is that on the time-lapse feature, you were able skip through it, or speed it up, like a normal video. But overall amazing app. 2022 update: literally in my \"needs\" category. I bought the paid version, was irritated by additional subscription services for full access. I still use it but am a bit bitter. I feel like someone got greedy... I use this app regularly. It's user friendly, and loaded with the tools a that are vital to a desperate starving artist. No intrusive ads, and so many features. Love it.. i rarely rate apps, but i have to rate this one its The best Drawing / Sketching app i use! i've tried a lot of drawing apps, but this one is the best!!, there are tons of brushes! amd its very easy to draw! i only have 1 problem when i draw/ color something it undo it even im not pressing the undo button , thats my only problem! after all this app is great!. I rate this a 5 stars because this is an amazing drawing app, like the best for the one's who cannot afford an apple device. If you are on android and you want to download Procreate but it's not available here, Ibis Paint is a saviour for artists and begginers like me. Anyways, this app are kinda like Procreate but a little bit different. This app is free, and you can just watch an ad to get the pencils free. I really recommend on downloading this app ^^ Thanks Ibis Paint. This is so COOL the other brushes are nice (even the colour mixer ones idk) theres comics (atleast thats what i call it) and pepoles art are amazing in the Gallery and you can also save artwork to your collection If youre offline!! I have this app on my other device (*which im not gonna tell*) so yeah nice ibis paint X delevepors!!!! Thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude00. *Im not this amazed ever*. Been amazing until recently.. So I've ran into an issue where basically it lags and I can't draw anything for a few seconds. I tried doing what I usually do when it takes up a lot of storage which is delete and reinstall the app however the issue is still here. Canvas size is the usual 1000x1000 and I can't figure out what the issue would be \ud83e\udd14. I grew up using this app and learned to use it very quickly since it was easy to learn. There isn't so many ads that every time you do something you get one. You normally get ads when you save and leave the drawing screen to go to your gallery. The gallery is nice too, you can see all your art works quickly. You can save your artwork in png and jpeg or videos that show just about everything you do on your canvas and it's great! I could geek out about this app forever it's become my favorite!\ud83d\udc4d. Absolutely LOVE this app!! It has so many features that you can use without having to pay money. There is a option to buy brush tools, but you can easily just watch ads every 16 hours/ when you need a brush. Probably one of the best drawing apps for both devices. I also like how I can make amazing thumbnails. Everybody MUST download this.", "neg_reviews": "Dont get me wrong, I've used this app for years and its great, but all of a sudden its not working. I usually take a picture of regular sketches I've got in my sketch book so I can ink, color in, and shade without being afraid of ruining my drawing. But now it says that \"its out of memory\" and takes me to the biggining page of the app, can you fix this?. For starters, the app has crashed multiple times because of having too many layers (5) and the size of the drawing too big, or the memory on the app is low. I was also unable to download the movie because the original base was \"altered\" Overall, it wasn't too great. Also, the movies run slow when you preview them and sometimes it crashes because of how much buffering it was doing. It made me repeatedly RESTART MY PHONE and it's still slow. If I could, I would rate it even lower than 1. This used to be good for my chromebook but now it's bad. Whenever I color in the hair and I check to see if all the lines are connected and they are, I color in the hair and it colors the whole picture. It glitches my art and it erases the lines and I fix them to color it in again but guess what it does: it colors the whole picture again. I thought this was gonna be fun for me but I guess it is not. Please fix this bug, I really wanna draw with this drawing program.. I've been using this app for a couple of years now and I loved it :>> but ever since the recent update, I couldn't get to draw a single stoke on the canvas without lagging. I literally can't draw anything. I've tried deleting artworks, and reinstalling the app but it just got worse. My artworks are gone and I couldn't even use the app anymore :((. Please fix this, I really love this app.. It's good for editing images and making memes, that's about it. Whenever I try to draw, the brushes won't properly work, and will constantly jump. Plus, there's no way to edit brushes besides their transparency and width. You can't edit the sharpness of their edges at all, nor add any more brushes. As for the bucket, it adds a dark line around the lineart. Overall, it's absolutely horrible for anyone that doesn't have a smooth and rounded artstyle.. Ok so I used to love this app but now I can't use it because of this terrible glitch. I'll open the app and to edit something but then when I click anything on the bottom row like the one to change your brush, it freezes. White on the button (because I clicked on it) and it just crashed. I tried several things, restarting my device, deleting the app, trying a different picture. Nothing worked. Please fix this glitch!. Been using this app for a while now, all I can say is all is great. Not until the current update, ads are slowing the app down, the lag isn't cooperating when I'm literally drawing a line. I even had to delete an artwork I've worked for atleast a week, but only to realize that the lag didn't come from there. I'm genuinely upset about the new update, until now, all I can do is deal with it.. I have been using this art program for 3 years. I did not experience any lag or problems or glitches. Everything was going very smoothly. This is a very good app for beginners, but there are lots of problems. My first problem is, when I'm drawing, it lags a lot and when I draw a curve, it will make a straight and thin line i didn't wanna make. It also undos random lines and strokes. This glitch happened after I deleted and then reinstalled Ibis Paint X to Free up space. Please fix this.. The drawing is easy to use and has very few adds! Why the 2 stars? L A G . Ever since the new update it's been lagging out like crazy! If this isn't fix soon I'll have to swap to a new art tool. I've been using ibid paint for a little less then a year now and I've grown very used to using it. So do course I don't WANT to. But I might just need to. I have some art commissions I need to do that I can't! I'll increase the stars once it's fixed!. Although this app is extremely good, there are a few flaws. There is a Discord ad which lags the app, making it unusable until it goes away. It is impossible to draw whenever the advertisement appears and it appears very frequently. Also, the color picker sometimes activates even if I have been moving my pen around in different places for half a second or so. A nice addition would also be the option to change the size of the buttons on the screen like the undo and redo, but it isn't necessary.. I had really liked this app before and now the update has ruined it for me, it seems rather unorganized, now when i draw and erase the mark it does not fully erase, and the format in the gallery does not look right. I preferred the older version over this one. The older version was easier to work with and I could remember it easily. What the hell was the point in changing the app so much just for maybe a bug or two? And I feel like you should be able to delete the update, to me it has no use.. Yo! Back again with more issues. Ever since I updated this app, it ended up having a lot of problems. The app was lagging more than usual (up to the point where I can't draw a single line), it kicking me out several times, and it not letting me back in once I got kicked out. As well as the problem with the blur tools (same thing happens; kicking me out and not letting me back in). The fact that I'm not the only one with these kinds of issues is beyond me. Please fix this!\ud83d\udc95. I loved this app I really did, I grew so much and learned so many things as an artist. But ever since the newest update (August 2021) things got worse? I didn't mind the ads cuz I thought you guys deserved it...but after closing an ad the app crashed. Now I am no longer am able to open the app??? I have so much unfinished artworks on there, I just hope it won't be permanent.. I wish I could give this app 5 stars, I really do. It was an AMAZING app for art and the only application is ever use to draw/edit digitally. But ever since the update I it's been lagging really bad. I'm alright with a little lag every once and awhile, but it's gotten to the point where I can't even draw normally because it's so slow and terribly glitchy. Please fix this, I'm really bummed out! :(. This app is a really good app if you likes digital drawing, but after the new update, I realize its been glitching. There's once I use the \"magic wand\" to remove the background, and my picture suddenly changed the color, it became blue and grey. Its really laggy now, whenever I try to draw something, it becomes really laggy. I really love this app, please fix this.. This used to be one of my favorite drawing apps, but ever since this update, it's been really weird. It's kind of confusing to use, and theres too many buttons that are on the screen. First of all, because of the update, the eraser tool won't fully erase anything. So now erasing is way harder than it's supposed to be.. Great app for art! Just a few requests and glitches. I wish we can export and import our art to other devices to we can have out artworks on more than 1 device. There used to be no glitches until this happened. Seems like it's not because of my device. The same glitch happens on my phone. The app starts to glitch and it shuts down and it won't save your art! I searched it on YouTube and the same thing is happening to them. Please fix that glitch. Other than that, amazing app!. I loved the app before, but due to the new update my opinion has drastically changed. The app was smooth and wonderful as it was before, but the new layout is ugly and unappealing. When I try to doodle, the brush is too slow and lags so bad, when I complete a whole circle it takes a minute or two to catch up with my speed and sometimes even crashes. Please, for all digital artist's sakes, FIX THIS.. This app was great at first. I could draw for free, and I just had to watch a few ads. Then the video ads glitched the app every time I wanted to draw. A discord ad would make it so I couldn't even draw and for 3 minutes all I could do was wait for it to be gone, only for it to come back minutes later. Ads are fine as long as it doesn't make it impossible to use the app.. I've been using this app for 1-2 years now, ever since it was perfect. Nothing goes wrong until the new update. It's the ads, I understand why's there ads. Though, the ads now doesn't show an \"exit - x\" button and I always gets stucks in the ad. Because of that, I couldn't use any pens (the ones that you need an ad to watch). I hope that those type of ads will be removed.", "pos": "Users rave about ibis Paint X's extensive features, especially the vast library of over 7100 brushes and its user-friendly interface.

And lot of stories to look over. Children's books are also available here. I hope they will enjoy this app.Many more features have to improve to read easier way than now. I hope for more good books for children. Thank you.. Google Play Books is a high-quality, well balanced app, with an extensive library of ebooks, audiobooks, graphic novels, comics, and more. I find that the recommendations tend to be impressive, informative, and interesting. I also use the Scribd and Audible publishing services, and Kobo too. I find that Scribd is the most economical choice of the these, but that Google Play Books has the most balance and is a great service that deserves nothing less than a glowing five-star rave review. Amazing!. I love using it so far. It provides a great interface and a smooth reading experience. However, I would love if there are options to organize or sort my books because so far my collection is growing and I need something to better keep track of them. Edit: I'm giving this app a 5 star since they now added the option to sort my books in different shelves. Now, its even easier to browse which is exactly what I'm looking for. Thank you so much!. I love this app. The Read Aloud function alone is worth the 5 * rating. In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.. A great app. Well i would like to add that while its good for epub, its absolutely woeful for PDFs . You already have Drive PDF reader, so are not lacking in the required area . Just integrate it with Play Books .... I wont reduce my rating cause i know its tough to keep a good app working . But you have got to step up your game on PDFs . Right now its just best effort. Almost like you are supporting the format grudgingly. Unfortunately not all books are in epub format.. Good app for all the book lovers. We can download any book online to read it offline from the Play store. There is availability of auto-read with a clear voice in any language. Also we can download English dictionary to find out the meaning of the words which we are not aware of, which it-turn increases our English knowlegde. I liked the page-turning effect which feels like real-book reading. It is also available in dark mode. Great user-interface. Great work team!. It is a really nice app. I have tried to find different apps for ebooks and audiobooks but nothing was really my fit. When I found this app, I thought that this was gonna be like other apps, but I was impressed. Overall, I really reccomend this app as it is suitable for all ages and hope that more books will be displayed so I can stay consistent with my reading :).. That's really a wonderful app. Only the thing, the read books still appear in the main list of books with those not started, and also in the list of finished books, with download option. This causes confusion between read and unread books in the list. Also, the read book gets downloaded every single time when it gets clicked unintentionally. So the books need to be sorted out completely according to categories: not started, in progress and finished to avoid further confusion. Thanks.. As an eBook reader, the app is pretty good. There's amazing competitor apps, but I read books partially with the intention of enhancing my vocabulary, and Play Books does offer the easiest, smoothest way to look up a word (in-app). I can also highlight words and have them be saved in Google Drive, which is great for revising those new words I'm learning! Also, being able to access my personal uploads on both PC and mobile is helpful, too.. New review! I actually really love the app. The night light mode is basically all that was missing. Now that it has that feature, it works great! I actually love the amber colors more than the regular black/white! Great job google. The app is fantastic!. They just keep improving this app. Showing number of pages left in the current chapter is such a nice feature added. Upgrading from 3 star to 5 star. Keep up the good work guys.. I've used Google Books for many years and enjoy it very much. The improvement I'd like to see is to have its page layout be more user-friendly on an Android phone. I can barely even SEE the screen size -/+ symbols! It's like the page layout was never updated; it's still the same pc format. Thanks.. This app really good as I expected. Evan thought there are many features such as easy to transfer, free of cost and many more which I like. Thank you google for giving us plenty of features all readers. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42. I love Google play books. It's my favorite app because I LOVE to read. They offer 100 books you can choose from and when they see what you pick and choose to read they offer more of that genre. I always have at least 1 book pinned that I'm reading. The books that they do sell run from $1.00-$20.00. This is a good app and I recommend it to anyone that likes to read.. The interface is very smooth and mocks the animation of pages flipping. Most importantly you get tons of free books to enjoy your reading exprience. Love this app!!. I love this app!! Reading is a passion of mine so i love that there are so many free books available for when you're on a budget or cant afford to buy any. But then they also have books from a penny on up and a lot of times you get better deals than if you bought the actual book plus the app offers coupons like $3.00 off your next book which is amazing!. Update: They added the shelves. Kindly add the option for series customisation by users of uploaded books. The option to shelf books in various shelves is also needed. Otherwise nearly perfect app with many fonts, three themes including white, sepia and dark also with blue light filter option. The option to add bookmarks and notes with variations in nice colors, i.e., blue, red, yellow and green is also appreciated.. A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.. Add the following features 1. Blur/erase option for the text, 2. Underline option, 3. Hand drawing mark option, 4. Book transfer option to friends with a charge of 10% or 20% of the book price, 5. Show the publication date & file size in the about section, 6. Update/upgrade of books after publication of new edition, 7. Copy text option, 8. Fix the blur-text while zooming, 9. Add various filter options while searching books, 10. Voice change & speech speed change option.

PLEASE fix this app! I rely on it, because I can \"study\" a book on one device, and the notes, etc, carry across all my devices. This was awesome, but now?.......not so much.. I downloaded this because I was excited to download a couple of free books. Installed it and the books don't load,the one that did has a contrast problem that renders the books basically impossible to read. So I tried downloading them again with the browser I have and the site design changed and the Google Books is now asking for money ? I suspect that this was deliberate. I'm not happy about this. And it worries me to think about the future of education anywhere. Versailles ?. Every thing was going well, listened to quite a few audio books at work. Then the search function stopped working 2 weeks ago, so I'd have to go through the regular play store to find books. Now the entire app seems to not want to work properly. Just bought a new book through the play store, and it's not in my library nor will it play if I select it through the play store. Terrible. bought a $40 book that was barely formatted. Could not find chapters, only sections, had only section headings. To find a chapter, you had to already know the chapter names (with a print copy, etc.) and then go to the beginning of the section and scroll page by page looking for the chapter name. Each section could be 75 pages long. When I requested a refund, the Google chat assistant gave me a run-around, telling me to send screenshots, which would not have helped, as it would have required sending dozens of screenshots. Screen sharing did not work. I have two I-pads and a Dell XPS8730 desktop, so it is not my device that is faulty. It was clearly the ebook that was poorly formatted. What a waste of time chatting. You have a week to return an ebook with Kindle. Google shouldn't be so cheap. I was just at the 1 week mark. You have only 48 hours apparently to return .a book if it is badly formatted, etc. The last time I will buy a Google Play Book. Do not buy books here. I can see why few people do, compared to Kindle. For a huge global corporation, this is pretty shabby. The chat session was ridiculous: they could have opened the ebook themselves on their end and seen the problem right away. Instead, they stonewalled. It would have taken another 90 minutes to send them dozens of screenshots so that they would be convinced. Either they're being deliberately obtuse or they're inept/stupid. I told them the idea of screen sharing was a stupid idea, and the chat person threatened to end the chat. Just as well. It was a pretty stupid chat.. Horrendous sharpness and clarity image quality for comics and manga pages. Really needs to add an HD feature for the people who want to read their collection at its full resolution with no buffer/blur when scrolling through a page on phone screens.. I'm not a person to do feedbacks, but this is the WORST app I have encountered on Google Play store. This app does not work! I have been through support steps, uninstalled, cleared cached etc.. done everything I can but still, I cannot find my bought books in the library, and cannot even use this app to its potential. Everytime I use this app, it comes up with a constant in your face, annoying message. Couldn't retrieve Google books... I would appreciate some help with fixing up this dodgy app.. 1. Whenever I'm highliting the texts then trying to translate the same highlited part, it's translation is showing but after transliteration the highlighted texts suddenly disappearing. 2. While using from another device, if I'm editing something, it's taking a long time to upload in the other devices.. Bought an issue of a magazine so I could read a short story from it. Unfortunately, the text was too small, and there was no way to zoom it properly. It zoomed in like how it would a picture, instead of blocks of text, so instead of enlarging the text in a way that had all the words fit on the screen, it zoomed in by cropping other words out, so you had to drag it from the left to right to read a full sentence. An unnecessary obstacle for trying to read.. Used to be good, but now will not keep downloads on drive. Every time I log off the internet, books disappear from drive (these are books that I have paid for), then, if I want to continue reading, I have to wait hours for the book to re-download, and of course, when I logoff again, the books are lost again. This app has, basically become useless. After all the money I have invested in ebooks, it feels like I have been burgled! In conclusion - I am NOT a happy bunny!!! Peter Thompson. There is major issues with background data usage on uploaded PDFs. Today I downloaded a book on my phone, a pdf file which is roughly 63 MB, I put my phone on screen lock while being on one of the pages in the book. 30 minutes later I find out that Google Play Books have used 2.2 GB as background data (with a pdf that is 63 MB)... To make matters worse.. The book hasn't even been fully donwloaded yet!!!. I have enjoyed this app in the past, but ever since getting my Note 9 and installing Play Books, it won't download my library. My connection seems good, it's the right account, I've tried clearing the cache & data, and also uninstalling and reinstalling and it's the same. Can't download library. I just don't know what to do besides what I've already tried.. Please put a clear search history button. It is very annoying to see the previous searches standing there. The Google support team does not even care to read this review because it's been standing like this for 3 months and I have edited this today 11 Feb 2022. All I asked was for them to add a method to clear search history and they don't care.. Please put a clear search history button. It is very annoying to see the previous searches standing there.

All I asked was for them to add a method to clear search history and they don't care.. Worthless. Works well on Android but ONLY Android. Downloaded books to Windows, are read on Adobe Digital Edition (a poor reader) only but there is no sync of pages, bookmarks, highlights, notes. On Mac, I have yet to figure out how to download books, though it's \"authorized\"; I presume there's no sync. Why I would buy ebooks from Google Books when Amazon Kindle Books are same or cheaper priced and sync perfectly on everything I own-Android, Windows, Mac?. I used to love this app, but the last few days it won't open any of my books. I tried removing and re-downloading my books, and when that didn't work I uninstalled and reinstalled play books, and it still won't open any of my books. I am very frustrated because reading is the only thing that keeps me sane. If there is anyone that can help me fix whatever is causing this issue, I will change my rating to 5 stars accordingly.. I use this app as a default ebook reader. Many a time, importing books take a lot of time, displays \"processing\". Most of the time, when I cancel it and import again, it might go well. Sometimes I had to abort the import and don't do it. Sometimes the alignment might not be good for imported books. Seems like the app needs more work on fixing bugs. Nice concept, though. Hope these would be fixed soon.. The app works. But it's a disorganized mess. After all of these years, and entering with such a big splash, why has Google done so little to compete in the ebook market? This lacks basic features that other ebook readers have had for many years. Even free book reading apps from playstore are far superior. I don't understand.. Alot has improved from the beginning.. yet alot has to be fixed.. like the 'read aloud' could have a play n pause button or something.. also give us the option to start 'read aloud' anywhere from the middle... I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.. The update didn't \"fix bugs\", it apparently gave it some. It is now constantly popping up with \"not responding\" messages. I can't go for more than a couple pages without it freezing. Rather reminds me of youtube, which does the same thing, and which also hasn't fixed their issues. Please fix this or I will be forced to purchase books elsewhere.

It was nice having a fresh new track to play every week. Not digging the new Jam interface either. The Career tier interface has been reworked and it's not as intuitive as it used to be. I can't replay a level without being sent all the way back to the main menu and having to scroll to get back into whatever track I was in. Very confusing. This is a fun and entertaining game which I have spent countless hours playing. I hope they at least reconsider bringing the Premium tracks back.. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50! I absolutely love the idea of this game. My favourite part is that you can upgrade starter bikes all the way to 31 pump, jump and speed ,when you have progressed far enough, as the last bike doesn't have many good skins in my opinion. Also, the fun never stops because when you finish all of the pro tracks you can do Versus and Jam (at any time you like) which put you against real players!!!. I see a lot of people complaining in the reviews about \"even if you have max stats... Etc blah blah blah.\" The devs arent going to be straight with you. You can beat it without spending a dime. If you cant beat it you just suck. For real. Love this game beat it decided id pay for vip. Great time kill and great challenge. Would love a 3d first person version of this game. Remove the battery saver, there's already an option performance vs graphics, when it's accidentally turned on, game stutters like crazy.. This game is amazing. For all of you saying its rigged and it's too difficult I will say the following: you can have the best bike out there, maxed with all its attributes but if you miss time a jump and slam into a hill, a fast bike and a high jump cannot save those three seconds lost. Dont quit, get your technique down and you can win.. Great game if your into stuff like this thanks for the recogmend I love this game I'm on bike 4 in 2days ahahahaha I don't stop playing it in the house or out with my mates thanks guys if you need a WiFi less game this is the game for you, you will enjoy this game as much as I do if your into biking and racing games love this game so much I will always play it until I complete it I can't get board of this game Eather brilliant game\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udd19\ud83d\udd96\u270c\ufe0f love it so much thanks guys enjoy guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Pretty good game but If the cash you earn for the quick races or whatever they are were a bit more,like easy would be 900,medium would be 2,000 and hard would be 10,000.Im broke so It'd be nice if they did this and it would make my day better. Also if you want me to buy premium wait until I have the money instead of constantly saying \"buy premium to get exclusive stuff\". Sorry if I sound like a choosing beggar,I'm just kinda peeved that the cash is low in the quick races. Worth the buy though!:D. When i downloaded this game for the first time, the GUI was so different, there was no character display on the menu screen, the screen has changed so much, \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. Great game... Just CANNOT it is literally impossible to pass the 11/12 the last level of that level! I tried the headstart and white line to follow but doesn't help! The opponent is wayyyy too fast. The upgrade for the bike is on max for all three things of speed etc.. I really just can't pass. Please fix this. Also, it says to complete level three in order to get the bike, but when i try to get the bike it says complete level three but cant. Btw it is an amazing game I genuinely recommend this!. I love this game do much i think that it is amazing it really is there are so meany diffrent things to do i really recommend are different levels different Maps and you can choose a map and if you win some money and there's also Different Bikes in skins for your life and outfits I highly recommend this game 5 out of 5. Easily one of the best games on android. If you think you hit a pay wall you just suck and didn't learn how to ride fast. You can finish the game without paying a penny. Ads are not bad and easily bypassed if you just don't want to watch them. Fantastic job with every detail of this game. I'm sorry to say Mad Skills Motocross missed the mark entirely but this game is as close to perfect for what it is that I can't imagine changing anything.. Once you get the hang of timing the jumps it's a really good game. You don't have to put which is great! Also I am very appreciative that I can play without WiFi or internet because I live in a rural are where there's no service.. I love the game it's the only game I play on my phone. I've beaten the game and even bought premium to keep playing because I love the game so much. I have road every map. The only thing I have a problem with now being level 48 and have a lot of money I stopped getting my double $/XP all of a sudden.. Super fun game and 8t doesn't seem to ever get old. Keeps me entertained for hours when I have time to kill like on my flights and such. Great job to all the developers. Just keep updating it and making it cooler aka more dope each year like F1 has done besides their new mobile update this year. I can't wait for the next update or generation to this game and see what you guys do to it to make it better with the technology we have these days. *This game need to evolve with the rest of the world.. Great game, although it gets very hard towards the end of career mode to win without rockets. I did beat career mode without them, I'm happy to say. But 4-5 of them i thought i never would win, evem with my bike maxed out amd their's not. U just have to be perfect on every jump, pump etc. And wait til.it gives hints from watching ads, then it shows the best path on the track, if keep failing then it gives u a small headstart and then they are possible. Folks saying its not poss gave up to easy. Very good game I like it but once you have fully upgraded all bikes and are well and truly into jam rounds your money increases heaps and there is nothing to spend it on so yeah that's just one thing i would like to see fixed. Mabey add some more bike or riding gear. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. This is a very interesting and beautiful game...Its challenging cause your timing has to be perfect. The attention to detail is amazing... Tip: If you want to slow the replay ..just touch hold on your screen and slide your finger slowing in the direction which u want to slow it down..... you can rewind the replay by swiping left and fast forward swiping right ....Its beautiful \ud83d\udc4d. Really enjoy this game. Great graphics and great controls as well. Easy to learn and fun to see how well you perform on the global leaderboards after every track. Ads are minimal and non intrusive.. amazing it's a really good game if you know what your doing here's a tip fully upgrade your bike then you will beat the bosses easier. My first Google Play review This game is an absolute blast. Once you spend around 3 hours on career mode, you can fully upgrade a bike and play the best players in the world online! I've logged over 200 hours on this game and am consistently in the top 1% of the game. This game is all about flow. Gain speed down the jumps and get big air up the jumps. So much fun. Zero issues whatsoever with this app.", "neg_reviews": "Money money money that's the name of the game for the developer. Good game which plays well! There is no way of progressing without spending money!!!!. You earn game dollars for minor upgrades for racing. However you need gold to buy most things like new bikes, and booster rockets and for this you have to spend a lot of money (if your not careful this could easily run into \u00a3100's). You can not exchange game dollars for gold. This has the potential for users to spend a lot of money be warned.. This was a great game at first. The prizes were adequate to purchase upgrades and stay competitive. Then wham, you advance to the level 7 bike and trying to get the level 8 bike is IMPOSSIBLE! how the heck are you supposed to by a $50,000 bike when you're awarded a measly $75 per win? Absolutely lopsided, ridiculous and irritating. I need $38,000 to reach the upgrade, that will take me 500 more gamea... now way. Deleting. Do not waste your time and download.. The update ruined the game! All bike upgrades are now double the cost and the videos you watch are for less money. A good game ruined by stupid developers. The jump button doesn't work at points in time. Your speed slows down. It's all geared to get you buy.. Make so you can trade cash into gold. Max level from 50 to 100, maybe some new bikes or at least some new paint jobs, I've got millions in cash, nothing 2 spend it on and thats pretty sad. There nothing to look forward to in this game, other than the Jam event and thats getting really really old too. Maybe you guys can make 4 to 5 new bikes and 3 new levels of tracks, or make divisions at exsisting tracks that are Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. A way to trade cash for gold !. I first gave it a 4 star rating because I really enjoyed the gameplay, but the game has come to the point where I am almost forced to pay to proceed, which I will not do, I understand it's supposed to get harder, but the difficulty spike is really unfair I feel, why did I spend so much time earning credits to upgrade my bike if some npc with a way less upgraded bike than mine can beat me so effortlessly?. Excellent game. Great skill ceiling and awesome juice. Some ads are game breaking though and the monetization model is p2p. I know this is a mobile game and mobile games are directed towards whales and halfwits, but this is a sad waste of an almost perfectly executed concept. I doubt anything will change so well done \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Good. To a point. There comes a point in this game when you've maxed out all your bikes, you've got about 500k in the bank and nothing to spend it on, and yet you are physically slower than all your opponents. Its a shame because its enjoyable, but even with all the skill in the world you won't win. You can't even pay for upgrades with real money, so I don't even see the point. Its not a pay wall, its just poor game design.. Very bad matchmaking in the career mode (not sure about PvP though). Even though you are matched up against bots that are level lower than you, the bike they use are far superior than you have. They not only have better suspension (which is nothing) but the speed of their bike is 6 or 8 levels ahead of what you are using. Which forces you to consider about paying for better bike or playing the same level again and again. And also sometimes the up button doesn't make you jump at certain times.. This game is fun at first, remind me of the 'Trials' series a lot, but you quickly realise that attempting to play this game for free is pretty much impossible. Most items are simply too expensive for you to unlock one after another, unless you throw your wallet at the phone. Uninstall once you reach that point.. I'm not gonna be one of those people who freaks out in reviews but seriously at first I thought I was just bad but I had a bike with 22 speed, 24 pump and 23 jump and a bike with literally 8 speed, 8 pump and 8 jump literally passed me at the beginning of the game when there were no jumps or hills. I dont wanna say that its a scam because overall I love the game but seriously though this is crazy. I still love the game but please just fix it.. Was decent, but no real expansion since it's original release and now they've dramatically lowered the financials on quick play from an 800 reward to 20 and no way to earn gold bars. What once was worthy of 4 stars is now 2 stars at best Gameplay is good, but with the changes recently, it just doesn't hold up over time.. Since the update the games is slow and glitches a lot while playing the jam. I payed so I wouldn't have advertising but they have put it on billboards to get round that.. Game would be great if it stops glitching every round. Almost as if it was intentional. Poor optimization that ruins gameplay. I have a high end device more than capable of playing anything on here. More irritating rather than challenging.. I'd imagine most of the 5 star reviews are payed for by these scummy devs. the games progression is completely jacked, the amount of money you need to upgrade and beat the levels is stupid compared to how much you actually get for winning. the whole things set up to make you spend money on it. and the controls are infuriating at the best of times.. I realy liked the game at first because it was easy to beat. But the it got to the point where I had maxed out my bike and the AI wasn't maxed out on anything, yet they still beat me. I was going to by more gold to get rockets, but no. The game is just a scam for your money. DO NOT buy anything off this game.. Terrible experience!!! Graphics, game play... that's fine, but there's no fun at all. You must buy in app to pass certain levels because they are so hard. Stupid game and stupid way to earn money. Uninstall!!!. Well very nice gameplay and I enjoyed this for sometimes but after some few levels,It becomes very difficult to win & jump button don't works fine.Always had to restart...It's just a pay to win game,uninstalled.. Ironic its called \"mad skills\" but it has the most elementary control scheme ever. Its very boring game with a terrible controls. Its basically a flappy bird of this type of games. Boo. THIS GAME IS RIGGED. When devs respond with \"pick your line\" or \"it just takes practice. I know you'll like it\", they're just taking out their asses. Whether the opponent has the EXACT SAME BIKE AND STATS AS YOU or a bike and stats that are WORSE THAN YOURS, YOU WILL LOSE!! If it isn't rigged, explain how 3 seconds into a race, the opponent/AI is already 50-60 meters ahead BEFORE HITTING ANY JUMPS or how they overshoot one, land on a flat and NEVER LOSE ANY SPEED. I do it and lose half speed.. I was suppose to give more than 5 stars because I have been playing this game for over 3yrs now and it's the best BMX game I have ever played but after I finished playing all the characters I updated the game but nothing changed... I'm still playing the same stages and characters I have played pasted before That's very bad because I updated the game with internet so that was just a waste please do work on that", "pos": "Negative reviews for Mad Skills BMX 2 mention dissatisfaction with the new update removing premium tracks and changes to the Jam interface.

This help me alot in my difficult situations. But one thing that i want to change is that if person is walking then this also shows the kilometres or speed if it is change according to the activity of an individual like if someone drive a car or who wheeler the small sign is show at the location. If you solve this problem then there to nothing to say any negative point of this application. Thanks.. This app is good but the only problem is that it doesnt work everytime, the person have to open the app toh update their location, thats why we are not able to know the collect location, fixed this problem, jisse bina aap khole hi person ka location update ho jaye with the help of their data connection. Best app ever. I love the app but the problem is that you don't get all the emoji unlocked you need to add more and more friends for that and also there are 4 icons and 3 are locked and you need to login in a row and add more and more friends. But leaving these things the app is very good and it also works properly without any glitches and bugs. At the end I would them 4.8 or 4.9. And also there are no ads. And its easy to use the app.. I wanna say that this app is best. After reading some reviews and watching ads I thought that this would be a bit boring app but it's awesome. Also I love the sign in page \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 it's kinda good and the app is cool. You are doing good progress. The app works completely fine also it's better than Google find my device (don't tell them okay or they will ban me from Google Play\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00). This app is excellent, but there are some minor issues like the location is not updating in real time, it takes time to update (about 2 to 3 seconds) and sometimes when your mobile data is turned off, or you are in low network or signal coverage area, or your device is in airplane mode, or your device is out of battery (0%\u26a1), then it will not show the location... Otherwise, the app is good. Thank you ****Zenly****. I love this app I just want small improvement if I can see who have viewed my location it will be fantastic...... It's a good app, but I have this only one complaint that as my friends Try to see my location they are not able to see as it always shows that my location is off. Please help me sort out this problem. Rather than this the app is the best.. Great great app i just want to see other location shown in the ad but i cant and its important for me for some thing so um can you kinfly put that. I just want to say, this is the best app i have ever used. It literelly tells the correct location also with the time and phone battery. Zenly, please dont delete this app and dont add prices for usage. Thanks zenly company for giving such a wonderful app. This app is the best.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. Tbh it's the best app I've ever used like literally locatio,phones battery percentage,moving direction,speed of them,direction and distance with messaging feature this can be the future of ideal social media,the response from the team is even more awesome ,love u zenky pls don't spoil this with premium charges or an update mess. Everyone, when they ask for your contacts don't panic, They are not going to let everyone know where you are. They ask for your contacts just in case you want to request them to join you on zenly . You have to send your contacts a request first. I can not believe you all are leaving negative remarks without giving it a chance. Just being so quit to judge. Yes, it has flaws , but most of the time it's accurate. My daughter & mom we had zenly for about 6-7 years. We use this app for emergencies.. I am giving 5 star because the feature are very good, but you shoud try to locate thing more perfectly, my home is i am 100 m wrong, and you should try to better user interface, try something minimal. I loved this app. I salute the developer because the interface is very neat and clean and it help other friends to find where are they. I request you to please develop more,like, 1. Find the way to the friends we want to meet. 2. Show the contacts on the map who are in zenly,etc. I really loved this app and say the developer that if you update this app like this only than you will be the no. 1 play store. I hope you will do this. Thank you!\u263a. I love it. This app isn't only for fun, it's for protection too. If anything happens to a friend, you can track them or show their location to the police. Also, this is helpful if you are going to their house for the first time or if they moved, since their are directions to their location. I love the emojis that you can send, they're so fun, especially the poop emoji! The feature of seeing your friend's charge is also helpful. I love this app and would really recommend!. I tried many location tracking app so my family members can be at peace and no doubt Zenly is the best of them all. Have been using it for 3+ years now. It is accurate most of the time, low battery usage as compared to other such apps, & the developers constantly add features to this app - they maintain a funny flavour in whatsoever useful features they add-something very unique to this app love it. A big thanks to the developers -Not many apps give the level of satisfaction that this app does. Zenly is as straight forward and simple to use app. Via a map based interface, you can locate where your friends are at any time and vice versa for them. The bonus feature in Find My Friends is that you can also chat with your friends while they\u2019re en route to meeting up with you, or simply to be nosy and see what they\u2019re up to. At any time, you can consult details like how long they\u2019re going to be until they reach their destination, as well as receive directions to where they are. U Share memes. Really loved this app!! The features are just incredible, I'm able to know my boyfriend's location, send voice notes, emojis and all are just amazing. Nice. I wish there could be optional settings like, I receive notifications when someone's battery drains to a certain point, or when they goes to a certain place. And I hope the app can have dark mode cuz the chat and profile really burn my eyes when I look at them in the dark. Edit: also I want your Snapchat avatar to be on zenly too, I kinda like that artstyle. Nice. I wish there could be optional settings like, I receive notifications when someone's battery drains to a certain point, or when they goes to a certain place. And I hope the app can have dark mode cuz the chat and profile really burn my eyes when I look at them in the dark. This is wonderful app, always accurate, I recommend if someone is looking for any gps tracking device for your kids, family , friends and near dear ones...

He is working in my phone some slowly and that not batter for any company. Zenly should show us our correct location. I live in India but first time i started this aap with location then I found that I'm in inland and that's huts me. Zenly should give us free trail without any invite friends. That's why I gives you only 2 star.. Being able to add strangers to follow you now!! Shocking. Don't download this app if you don't want the ability for strangers to add your children!!!! I have used this app for a long time. Now you have a chance to add strangers. And obviously they can add your child if they accept them! Zenly it's not strange, atleast know what your app is capable of before saying my comment is strange!! It certainly isn't mutual friends. They or I don't have friends thousands of miles away!. Latest update, location locks. Left the app open with 4g/5g WiFi and location turned on but still doesn't update. Update: uninstalled and installed and still same issue. Location of contact doesn't update even when I've left the app open for 5 minutes with 4g/5g connection. Developers comments to look at troubleshooting tips doesn't work. If I had managed to troubleshoot, I wouldn't have had to leave this negative review. Any help? At this point I'll just tell all my contacts to abandon zenly.. I love the concept and I like how it tracks which parts of the map you've already explored before. But now I've noticed tha sometimes my position will lock and get stuck in some place I was. I have to shut down the app and enter again, only to happen the same thing after 3 seconds. An app which the greatest deal is showing your real time position and is failing to do that... It's kinda pointless.. Don't download it. Totally waste of time bcuz you can see locations of those people who use this app and added you as friend on this app so there is nothing new or innovative. And a very humble request to team of zenly, I don't have any intentions to hurt your norms but if you advertise it, advertise with sufficient information. Don't exaggerate if it is not that much innovative.. Used to be a great app when it did the basics but over zealous developers have complicated the whole thing. Too much information, too many features. How do you know if someone is sleeping or just up late? How do you know someone is going home? Automatic scrolling through contacts is a pain in the arse, please revert to the manual button. Also Zenly will not show my constant position even though I have all recommended settings (I think). Location is on etc. - it used to work.. My zen doesn't up to date for my family location up to the time that I checked. It showed me 1hr or 4 hr ago that person was there. I had reinstalled the app, and it was working fine for a day. And happend again next day. Please fix.. It bothers me that for Zenly to work, I HAVE TO grant location access all the time. I get that the live location part is part of the point of the app, but I really don't like that I can't choose to just give my location only when I open the app. Forcing users to grant permanent location access makes this feel more like malware. Use this app all the time - love the regular updates & features. By far the best group location sharing app. I've been using it now for 1935 days following a stroke of genius. It still however lacks a crucial feature - a notification when a contact leaves a location, in addition to the existing 'when arrives' notification. It knows when people are at work, so a 'X has left work' notification would be the next logical step? Will update review accordingly when implemented. Love you too.. Zenly is a very cool app. I used it every day. After that, I updated the firmware version and now it does not work ... Endless loading on the background of ice cream (after registration and delivery of all permissions). I really want to use it, but I can't anymore... Waiting for help! \ud83c\udd98. You HAVE TO give it access to all your contacts or there's no way to continue to the next screen. No thanks, I'll add my contacts manually or not use the app. You don't need all my contacts, and I don't need business contacts finding me on a social media app. Frustrating! This app should be pulled from the play store for attempting to force users to grant permissions they don't agree to!. This needs to be more stable meaning the proximity of the person you are looking at. It will show someone sometimes 5 miles from where they actually are. Also there have been times when 2 people are in the same car and it will show one in the car with the mph and the other will be miles behind. Still shows someone at a place for hours and they will be somewhere else miles away. I really want to like this app but it needs a serious update. Lowered from 3 stars to 2. Now 2 to 1.. I have a great opinion of the app, I like that the features include them being seen \"on the move\" and how fast they are going approximately but my boyfriend has a tablet with service which shouldn't have any issues tracking because we have the location setting to ALWAYS ALLOW yet its always showing \"off the grid\" and only even updates when he OPENS the entire app!!! So there's some glitch and major flaws there. I can't rely on it now since this issue but with a cell phone it never will fail you. It was a really nice app previously until idk when the page kept requesting me to change the settings. On GPS alr still same. Need to restart then can. If constantly require me to on my GPS, how can I have a lasting phone battery? I can't be restarting my phone every now and then just to use this app.. Hmmm....way too many permissions required, you do not access to my location all the time....only when I need it.....not continuously. Plus why on earth would I allow you access to all my contacts????....Allow only the ones I need to see....not you.... uninstalled and would never recommend....oh and please do not reply with your standard \"....please email us to help us improve....\" blah blah blah.....if you want to improve listen and read what your customers are saying....improve that.. apps are very bad and i am disappointed. I can't see where my partner is. when I press my partner's name, I keep coming out 35 minutes ago only. while my partner's internet is very fast. i'm really really disappointed with this apss. please upgrade these apps again.. Downloaded so I could see where my friends were in case they got lost or something since they weren't from the city and the app worked for a couple hours and completely shut down afterwards. Could not even open it. A complete waste of space and time! I'd give it 0 stars if I could lol. Hit and miss. Its showing my partner being in the house when hes actually in work ... did work excellent now it's very lagging and majority of the time not accurate any more which is sad as I thought it was a wonderful idea really.. wish it didnt lag so much and more accurate i dont need to know where someone is an hour ago reason I have it is for safety for my loved ones I need to know where there are then not an hour ago.. I will not give any star to the app but I have to give because it will not post with give star because it waste of time it is zero.. it is not have any option to search the people you want to search a want to know where they are It is total waste of time when I see the advertisement of the zenly app I think it willsuperb but it was 0 total 0... I am requesting to jaldi creator please do a option for searching the friends where they are... sorry if you feel bad for my comment but it's true \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11.

If there was a way to stream it on twitch I would stream it for like 2 hours a day. Upon ranking up you unlock new guns, upgrades, earn game cash, and gold which is used for higher teir equipment/guns. I also like that there is clans and you can add friends. It also has items that you can purchase with real money via credit/debit card. I highly recommend you give it a try. ENJOY THE GAME\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. This IS my favorite game. Love the update..and the extras!! Keep up the great work. I can't get enough. I live here lol. Thank you! The Holly Jolly Was Aweesome!! Thank you team!!. This IS my favorite game. Love the update..and the extras!! Keep up the great work. I can't get enough. I live here lol. Thank you! The Holly Jolly Was Aweesome!! Thank you team!! This latest guys is the coolest!!!. best shooter on mobile hands down. it has everything. unlimited progression with a bunch of leaderboards. and you dont really have to spend money of you dont mind grinding. but you can just drop 34 dollars and get the largest premium pack youcan get and get yourself started with some good gear. thats all i did and i win most games. ive been playing for about 6 months and this game is always good for some quick matches.. Although the team balancing is still an issue, I love the new update! The gameplay and the button configuration, are all so good now than ever; many thanks to the devs! \ud83d\ude4c. Fun game, with good potential to advance without having to spend a ton of money. I like the option to watch ads for bonuses without being forced to watch them during the course of the game. the action is smooth and realistic, the graphics are detailed and well rendered, the weapon selection is broad, and I especially like the ability to use a knife in close quarters.. Iam up dating my first review . I've played all the f p s now on Google play and my honest opinion of this game is I really like it alot now . The game seems to running smoothly without a lot of problems. I think the graphics and game dynamics are really awesome and impressive. Yes its pay to play somewhat but not to bad and they don't constantly bombard you with ads from all sides . If there are guys cheating i haven't really noticed it too much . I mean its pretty good 2 play. Obviously it's not perfect, the gameplay suffers from a pay-to-win system, like with most mobile games. However, the game overall feels pretty free flowing, like how you can just hop in a match and rack up some kills, and no one seems to really care if they do really well as long as they don't do really bad. My point is that there's not alot of pressure to be \"the best\" player in the match, just shoot some enemies, and have fun. Also graphics are good, controls are easy, top 5 mobile fps game.. Love this game great graphics easy controls the only downfall to it is it no longer is supported by mobile data which is a real bummer cause if your somewhere there isn't a wifi connection your not able to login and play but other than that it's a great game I'm in an amazing clan which makes gameplay twice as fun and keeps game extremely interesting and competitive!!! But all an all excellent game.... Phenomenal Game. I was actually in the search for a Tom Clancy Counter Strike mobile FPS & came across this which totally blew me away. You SHOULD spend some money as you rise in Rank(OPTIONAL)but come on let's be honest. 1.It's worth the contribution 2. You will want to spend money so you can increase performance as you Rank & that's the fun part...Building your character up. My only wonder is why it has no diversity. What army has only one Ethnicity? Im not one to care about skin tone though. Great, game 10/10 Love it, I have played this Game for 5 years Now, i would say This, game is For Ten, and up Love it its a fun shooting Game play with Friends, and Family, I Play with, my grandmother, Love the skins You can do many options, of gamemodes Not for kids under 9 or 10, This is amys sons Review,. This online multiplayer shooter game is amazing and I recommend it to you. You can socialize with other online users and go to the battlefield with them. The graphics are super great. They are perfect because I can see other soldiers super clear even though the game is packed with action. You can make a contract and when you succeed, you earn an award. You can upgrade your weapons, buy wepon slots and so much more. Great work, I am addicted to this game.. The controls of the game are the only thing that bothers me. The limitations of the touchscreen platform are responsible for this lacking of sufficient, intuitive control of your character, I believe, as opposed to the game design, itself. A game pad controller on a pc would make the gaming experience, a memorable one. This, I say, with intent of complimenting this game. I love it!. This game is amazing I mean I've never played anything like it its quite fun and has it's own style too! I have enjoyed this game for awhile and would definitely recommend this over all other multiplayer shooters. Although i think the ammo count is really low, i always run out of ammo and have to use other guns but it isn't unbearable but i think it would be a bit better with an extra magazine. The game is really good, the auto shoot is really helpful, the weapons are good, and pretty much a simple shooting game. I would recommend adding events to earn extra money, and to keep the players more into the game. Other then thats the game is really good and fun.. This game has been my happieness and fury for so long, i realy recomend this. It might even be better than call of dudy mobile. I would play this instead. It is realistic and has the perfect touch of everything. All i say is add a battle royal with a big map that you have to find weapons and stuff and like 99 people. But now that is swit hed to this device, it gets to 100 percent and then crashes. Please help.. It's addictive. Fast and furious. It's frustrating at times. I've played for years, off and on. You don't have to pay to play, but you will end up grinding till your eyes bleed. Small glitches here and there. Graphics are cool. Sound effects are cool. Controls are cool. It's worth the download. Just wish the devs would make the weapons, the good ones, and the upgrades for them and armour, less expensive to purchase. But all in all, great job devs. 5 stars.. This is the best game I have ever played. I kept on searching for a game like. I could have played battlegrounds or free fire. But my parents didn't allowed me. But I definitely suggest people that they should play this instead of that boring battlegrounds or free fire. BEST GAME EVER.. Gritty, realistically immersive sets. Fast paced, non stop action. I am a new player, in terms of PvP FPS games, and this game in particular. Yet I have risen several levels in a few hours and been picked up by a squad. Without spending a dime! I see the pay to play option. Also the play to advance option without the massive advantage to paying players oft encountered in other games. A more level playing field, please excuse the pun! Three thumbs up!. Developers, please listen. Focuse on keeping the gameplay fair and based on player skill, rather than making weaponsor armor stronger. Fair gameplay is what matters most, not pay to win. Do t make the same mistake you made in World War Heroes, a great game that was destroyed because of pay to win. I'm writing this because I care, players should win based in skill not because they upgraded the hell out of a weapon. I hope you read this and please remember, fair gameplay is key!!", "neg_reviews": "The increase in prices in the last update, the cost of upgrading weapons and the multiple failures of the game in battle are ridiculous. It is illogical that the robots of the game have weapons that the common players cannot buy. This was a good game before. now it is ridiculous and unbalanced. and to think that I invested so much money in this game that now it is an absolute loss. I lost 11k gold trying to upgrade my weapons. 120 upgrade points and only get 1 point in all? seriously guys?. I'm amazed that certain player's can shoot around corners, you get shot behind cover, and the rules get changed for certain player's, alot of cheating, and not in the league that I'm in, because I don't have huge amounts of money to spend on the weapon's, upgrades, and other perks you get when you pay a huge amount for things, I used to really enjoy playing the game, until I learned how much cheating goes on.. Nothing more than a money grab, you can not be competitive unless you spend a lot of money. Considering if you buy the club with nails in it, you can kill anyone regardless of what armor they have!!! Not to mention the invisible players every 3rd board or so. Nice idea, piss poor development, seems this game is geared for pre-teens. Only bright spot is the Tunisia map, a little more spread out. The other maps are nothing more than a box.. Game has turned into a joke, beginners are matched against PRO players to force you to buy things in order to compete. Developers know but aren't smart enough to fix it. So don't waste your money. Game is all about who spends the most money to be the best. Game takes too long in upgrading weapons & armor unless you pay cash for them. Won't receive rewards as promised. Equipment (weapons especially) types are not labeled and grouped together correctly to show weakest to strongest.. Okay, another edit... Still half star (Wish I could) Once again. Here are some ideas to make this game semi-good. 1) Slow down the game so skill can become a factor, not just how much money you spend in game. 2) Reduce the damage output of all weapons by 10% so in a fight you can at least get to face your attacker before going up in smoke. 3) If you want to make more money off this game, do a better job controlling hackers because presently there are only 2 ways to progress, Spend money or hack.. Please remove your hidden hacks to players who use cheat codes and some places to hide and win. Your team dosent even reply on the suggestion Today 7th Aug again a player used cheat code with unlimited ammo and health Today TOLET_08 WAS USING CHEAT CODE FOR HEALTH. The latest update has made some of the game features unable to use. When you finish a battle your supposed to get a reward for watching a 30 second video and this feature no longer works. Then they let people cheat in the game for instance I have the level 16 sniper rifle shot someone in the head 26 times and they walked up to me and killed me with one stab of a knife. So you decide. Even after the new update the game still crashes. Not good enough. Expected better from you guys. Dont know if i am playing against bots or humans but the game could be better. You guys should try to optimize parts of the game as much as possible to emsure smooth play and no lag. You guys can certainly do better than this. The crashing, lagging and hanging is just whats holding the game back. Improve!. This is a great game until you advance a little ways. Then it's completely dominated by players that can afford $100 for a single gun. I would recommend Pubg as an alternative. It has tons more features and is also PTP but only certain parts. You can play evenly for free. There's also several bugs in the game that should not exist in a 6 year old app. The developers obviously are getting paid and not interested in getting up to date.. Installed game for the third time, but unfortunately it doesn't want to load, it either goes to a black screen or it automatically takes me back to my apps menu! Might have to uninstall! Had the game for months and loved it until this started happening! Soooooo disappointing!. The auto shotting is really bad. What's the point in playing a shooter game if you cant shoot? Build a real game!!!! I'm sad that I'm one of your many downloads and I wish I could give you Less stars. Plz just remove this game from life.. DSR sniper rifle is no good after the latest update, as it reloads after each shot. Looks like you messed up all the sniper rifles (based on another user). I even reinstalled and rebooted, but same problem. With all the reloadings after each shot, I will no longer play this game, as it will give me dizziness.. Azur Interactive Games Limited is corrupted, they ban people they don't like and they obviously just want our money. They make the game look nice but the gameplay and behind the scenes mechanics is all trash. Things that were fine, they mess with it and basically something that was already good, now it's not. They have been making trash seasons since Season 7 now is Season 13! Don't download this, they don't care about us anymore, they talk good but no action. I have proof for all this!. It was one of those games that I play a lot. But with this new update they have messed up big time with the controls. For a sniper weapon one misses almost all the shots if your weapon is not stable even if your aiming is correct. Previously that was not the case. Also for any other weapon the aiming has become tough now, even for an assault weapon a lot of it misfires. Hope the developers look into it and make the necessary corrections or bring it to previous state for controls.. All of a sudden it says \"unable to connect to server, check your internet connection\". Yet my connection is fine. EDIT: So after observing for a while, I conclude that I have been intentionally blocked. Even after your \"updates\". And no, I will not send more details to your email. Others having the same problem is detail enough. Big fail if this is how you solve your hacking problem: to randomly block innocent players. Take note, this is how you get from best to worst. Uninstalled.. Excellent game!!! Definitely not a CSGO copy more equavalent to Contract Wars, COD, and Insurgency Sandstorm combined. Superb graphics, realistic gun mechanics, and awesome gameplay. Could use voice chat and maybe a small campaign mode in the future would be cool. also this is. pay to win game which isn't fair. guys running around with 700+ armor/health are impossible to kill with non gold and non upgraded guns. game has excellent potential to be an actual \"PRO FPS\" as of now it's just a PTW.. please fix bugs since i did encounter some players who are not even detectable for auto shooting. i changed to manual shooting but still they are invincible. most probably they are using cheat code. we cannot even report them since they logged on using \"player\" name. until that thing is sorted out, i am giving 2 stars only. this games was soooo good until they added the major armor updates. it takes more than 2 clips to kill one person. and some people you can shoot them over and over with out missing and waste 2 clips ob them and have no effect on that peson at all. like its crazyyyyy over powerd its not fun nor enjoyble to play anymore. So the developers paid lip service and left the bugs intact. Looking for another game this is an action packed, pov shooter game. the radar view shows your enemies-sometimes. Will upgrade to 5 stars as soon as they fix the bugs with their adverts with get stuck and have to relaunch to fix. Also adverts should be less than 10 secs like other games. 60 sec adds are way way, I mean \"way\" too long and intrussive. Also,this business w imortal players or ones that don't show up on radar is BS. This is definitely a pay to play game. It is great when you start but by level 15 you definitely need to start buying to have a decent chance. Equipment is expensive and so are the skills you need to upgrade you avatar. You are talking about anywhere between 20 dll to 100dlls to get good equipment and skills. This is not a grinders game either so if you think you will get by by just playing, your are wrong. Also a few hackers already. I gave it a 2star because the game in it's self is good.", "pos": "Players rave about the \"amazing graphics\" and \"awesome gameplay\" of Modern Strike Online, drawing comparisons to popular titles like Call of Duty and CSGO.

I didn't have any complaint at all. I have a fun, adventurous & exciting experience with this game. Hope so you will be completing my request as soon as possible & had a great update \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42.. This is an absolutely astonishing game; one of the best endless runners I have ever played. Player models are fantastic and the sound and visual design is also impeccable. Furthermore, the game follows certain film mechanics, such as the unlockable areas on the map to explore, however, there are some improvements which could be made. There are a few bugs here and there, locked content and few purchasable items from the in-game shop. The game needs more frequent updates, but still a solid 5\u2b50!. Jumanji game is very good .In this game you want to run and catch the thife and take the gold .Their are many animals and the thife helpers to protect him. You want to pass waterfall and also mountains and also you want to cross storm . Animals came out from the storm and attack you and also you complete the 2 tasks everyday . You want to collect gemes, gold . Also you want to unlock the maps.This game is very very nice.. I will give the Jumanji epic run game to five from this game is awesome \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d but not the runner chose optional this game is important at run not push the enemy's and that gives green color pack i think \ud83e\udd14 that is diomands and gold is very good \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a I will very very like this game and.good people's this commet belive and download this game thank you\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39. I love this game,I enjoy it more than temple run ,and subway surfers.it,s adventures,just didn't know how time passes,but pls add more levels ,we are able to finish this game in very less period of time . other wise this is awesome game. Amazing game, easy controls and fun storyline - the only problems are that Jefferson ''Seaplane'' McDonough \ud83d\udee9\ufe0f (the fifth avatar from the second and third films \ud83c\udfa5), Ming Fleetfoot \ud83e\udde8 (the sixth avatar from the third film \ud83c\udfa5), and Cyclone \ud83d\udc0e (the flying horse and seventh avatar in the third film \ud83c\udfa5) are not playable characters \ud83d\ude14. Please add them in soon! Otherwise, this game is the best runner I've ever played (it's a shame that I can only give five stars!) - thank you so much! \ud83d\ude0d. This is a very good and creative game. I have played a lot of running games but this one i love it. Its very addictive. I play it every day but sometimes its game speed is rather slow or not normal even though its very fun. I gave it 5 stars because of the excellent graphics and entertainment regardless of the game speed. Please upgrade the game speed. I'm really enjoying this game so far, I'm a sucker for endless runners i love them and this one is attached to one of the best family classics Jumanji. I haven't seen the new movies because you can't beat Robin Williams in Jumanji but this makes me want to see it. This game is great though, I really like the car, waterfall and wall climbing segments it's pretty cool, the game looks and plays great.. Amazing graphics and it is so detailed and it includes maps from both of the 2nd and 3rd movies that just came out though all we need is some more of the characters from the movies like micplane and so on... thanks for making such a great game best game to invest time into it's like a better version of subway surf! Defiantly download this game! Thx bye.. My fav game all the time but when this coming soon problem be solved i unblock all maps and all characters and characters all parts but there is no update for the coming soon map and in challenge area only smolder was unlock other characters were still locked can you solved this problem as soon as possible that we enjoy the next map location and also the challenge characters and also please add some more maps in update so we play it all the time with new maps and things thank you....... I like this game. Very very much. Nice graphics. Nice controls. And satisfying. Please see my comment and download this game made by a kind person. This is such a great game the game play is in a word smooth and straight to the point no glitches or being slow it's a wonderful addition from temple run or any others run games in this nature and I like how this game has kept to the original characters bio from the movie as close to detail as humanly possible therefore this alone 5 \u2b50 The only thing I don't like about the game is when you collect all the gold and complete a lot of the challenges you have to always wait 30 secs or so to get it. I like this game very much and it graphics are awesome I rate it 5 because this is very adventurous and all level are very interesting. I don't know how the game works because I never got to play it!!I opened it and then everything goes black. I thought it was because I didn't turn on the WiFi,so I turned it on, but still it didn't work. So I thought that the game was staring at a black screen. I don't like to play any such game . I just found out! The problem is the WiFi! Without wifi the game works fine. And the game is awesome! I finished all the maps and am waiting for the next map \ud83d\ude44. Just pls fix the problem abt te WiFi\ud83d\ude42. It is a most fabulous running game which I had ever played . According to the description the game support various types of options including riding a bike, riding a car, and much more. It provide systematic controls and beautiful scanario. Thus, it absolutely be finest creation by crazy lab LTD.. I love this game I unlocked all the characters and maps and also I got lots and lots of gems I unlocked the jungle, the oasis, the dunes and mt. Zatmire coming soon I am very excited the new character.. Loved this game. Gonna play it everyday. You guys are amazing. Keep it up. Wish I could give more than 5 stars. It's even one of my favourite movie's game.\u2764\u2764\u2764\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.thank u so much. You know that I was dying to play this game when I first pre-registered for it and now I'm very happy......\u2764\u2764 pls make more fascinating games for me... Job well done! Love the graphics, the animation everything's perfect... Only thing I wish there was is when you start up the game you hear \"Welcome to Jumanji\" and wen you start running you hear the Jumanji drums or when the level gets harder or somn... Without those 2 things ... It doesn't give off the true Jumanji feeling tht we all know and love. Other than that, keep up the gd world! Lovely!!!. This is pretty fun game and the maps and chaters are cool \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e and the powers are also cool. I love the games so much but when I try to play on landscape mode it's not supportive as many others running games do. I hope i can enjoy the landscape mode after the next update. Thank You", "neg_reviews": "Game was good but then they took all the content that I spent my time and energy to unlock already and try and charge me $7.99 a month to access the material I already unlocked. Only thing new you get is a couple of stages. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL.. I played the game before it had these changes. I would rather have the game free and go through the ads rather than pay a subscription. I would rather pay a on-time payment than a subscription. This was a poor choice on the developers/companies part.. The game was very good to start, have been waiting for new content for ages but now they've locked all the new content and some old content behind a subscription you have to pay for, you can't even play as half the chatacters unless you pay extra! I had previously unlocked all the characters and fully upgraded all the outfits but now I am stuck using the 2 worst outfits and can only play as the first 2 characters, make the game free to play again. Im upset, extremely. Even though this is a really good game. I just watched an Ad to get one of the trasure box, I literally finished watching the ad the ad then went to Samsung store for me to download the game in the ad (I don't understand why the hell it would do that) after reopening the game I didn't get my box.Mi want mi treasure box ! Damn thief!. Super mad right now!!! I had all the characters for this game and almost everything maxed out. Now the update has remove two characters that I already unlocked and you want me to pay for this now. THIS IS SO DUMB! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!. I loved the game before the update. Had all levels unlocked. Had all characters unlocked. Had quite a few outfits and weapons maxed out too. Now everything I worked hard to get is gone all because they want people to pay. Screw that nonsense. Changes like this push people away, and I'm one of those people.. I haven't played this game in about 4 months and decided to get on; anywho I had all the characters and maps unlocked and found out you have to pay a \"VIP\" pass in order to use 2 of the coolest characters and maps. This game had so much potential but stopped playing cause it was little repetitive and was waiting on the \"update\" for a long time now. Welp this \"update\" sucked cause it's all about paying for what you worked hard for. Make the game free and maybe add more things for money. I enjoy the game, but often the quests take me in a loop, exactly the same route, I stopped the game on my own after the 17th time going to the same places, how are you supposed to get the items if you are continuesly going in the same direction. Is the game programmed to do it? Feels like.. I've been waiting on the promised updated for awhile now as I play this game leisurely enough to have almost every character maxed in at least one costume. However the introduction of the \"VIP\" pass, which for one is a freaking MONTHLY subscription, really? Monthly? You couldnt have made it a one time purchase maybe? But also it locked me out of not only characters that I have spent time upgrading but also skins that I have spent time upgrading behind some idiodic pay wall. Its not worth playing. This game is a good concept poorly executed due to the amount of bugs it has. This should be an alpha stage game and not publicly available in any way. The optimization is bad, stutters here and there, poor responsiveness. The maps aren't generated randomly, leading to a repetitive experience. The sounds in this game clash too. This game is incomplete, it feels like it was rushed and didn't get the refinement it needed, ultimately leading to a lack of polish. Also, scale it properly.. Animated characters look fun to play. Although the game could use a lot of improvements. Lack of instructions on the skills and other things make it hard to understand the upgrades. Gameplay is simple and graphics is average. The missions and achievements are not very hard to complete. However, every time any Google play achievements is completed, the game freezes until the notification disappears. In addition, touch response is kind of slow.. Completed all the levels waiting for them to add the new levels, it's been over 6 months now, still no new levels. I really like this game as well as the movie and i love all the characters the graphics is good and gameplay little bit laggy but its okay.maybe you can fixed that.hope that in the future update.thanks .Edit: Now when i open the app it automatically exit me from the game i dont know why i get all the characters and all my progress is gone because of that i uninstalled it.. Hmmm I just downloaded de game.......just for me to play the game and it has been loading for a very long time.....it is not opening I can't really fathom the problem.....for this am not giving de app only one star. Nice game and idea..multiple levels and characters makes more interesting..after latest update seems there are issues with maps..inspite complete its not moving to next level..also swipes does not work when an achievement is unlocked during running..please fix. Changed to 1 star after latest update of these VIP pass etc..very bad as there are lots of bugs..not sure if anyone QA it. Game is good. I am angry on you guys. I unlocked dune and snow environment. And you updated the game. Probably change the variables of saved data. Everything is locked again.\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 Also I unlocked Mouse and Shelly and now locked. My highscore is reset to zero. I found another bug in last build, if encounter again will let you know. Your QA has this major bug. Good luck.. This game is terrible! Awful lag, horrendous controls, terrible graphics, and garbage progression walls. This is even worse than Superman 64 in my opinion. Also, takes up way too much space. In conclusion, it's a terrible game that tries to cash in on the movie. One of the worst games ever! Do not get this game, it's not worth it! If you want a good game from this company, then go play Miraculous, it's much better than this trash!. Game freezes quite often which is very frustrating. At times, swipe dsnt work at all and the game will finish like that. Developers might answer like users do not have good performing phones and that is the reason for those issues. But i disagree. I am using Samsung J7 2016 right now and i am uninstalling the game too. Let me know your opinion.. After that update the game is totally busted. I cannot literally play the 'run' mode option in the game, but I can play the other mode called 'challenge mode' which comes with a motorcycle and Dr. bravestone will ride on it, and we have to finish the segment in about 40 seconds. The actual run \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udca8 mode is not available in the game it's stuck in like a weird screen appears and it is unable to move on. I have waited 20 mins for this issue but no use. Please help me fix this issue ASAP.. Updated the game so levels and characters that were already playable are locked behind a paywall.

After playing for 3+ years, Cooking Fever is still compatible for 90% - Paying players and 10% - Free Players. Gems + coins becomes requirement for all restaurant's upgrades for both interior and kitchen utilities. This game is a very slow journey for free players.. Best cooking game award in my opinion goes here! It gets challenging but that's what makes me like it. If I could fix anything it'd be to get more diamonds quicker in the slots house and, for it to not cost too many diamonds for everything. Make at least 2 items easy to upgrade. Alot are costing me too much. That makes me want to quit playing for the day when I know that I'm not getting anywhere and I'm stuck on a level until I get diamonds.. I love this game , the game is so EXCITED and interesting , I really enjoy this game, because the game so good i am suggesting you this beautiful game try it out guys \ud83d\udc4c try this game everyone the level is hard but its beautiful I am playing since 5 months try this game so amazing all the best of your levels ok byee......\ud83e\udd70. The only thing I can see the latest version of the most important thing is that the new year and I am a little more than a week or so to be the same as a whole range from the UK, I will not have a great deal with the same way that I am not sure about that the new 6th 9th December and January and February and March and April and may contain confidential and is filed a bit more about the delay in replying, and a half hours of the year and I am not sure about OK game of the year, but I thin game. This is an amazing app this is easy and hard at the same time but it's a nice app if you like cooking in apps or real life try this app now guys i can play this all day but you know we can't play all day we also have to sleep so yeah i wanna play it every day and if you play this all i think you'll think the same this is so fun so I think you should download it I'm gonna go play now!!!!!!!!! So funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. It's a very productive game and it's challenging. I like how you can complete tasks very easily and the upgrades don't cost many coins. I think this game is amazing I used to play it all the time and just got back into playing it again. My whole family used to love this game until we got bored and erased it, however I just downloaded it again about 2 days ago and I am now opposed like I was before.. I promise, \ud83d\udcaf this is not all about having an internet connection, IT'S THE GAMEPLAY ITSELF. \ud83d\udcaf Nice quality, nice graphics, and very good gameplay with new dozens of restaurants. It's very fun and my childhood nostalgia since it is offline update in the past. Sadly it is online now, but BIGGER AND BETTER and more FUN. Nice updates and update more to spice up the game. \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4d. This game is soo much fun. In this game you will buy restrants from the coins you make playing levels. In each restrant there is a seiries of 40 levels with three stars to earn each level. Each resterant is compleatly diffrent. The restrants really range. I highly recomend this game. The only thing i would not is to progress you need to buy dimonds with real money. I know what people say but in the new update if you compleatly finish the restrant you get a prize. I have goten 1000 dimonds!!!!!!!. I have been playing Cooking Fever since 2018. I have to admit I am addicted. The game is most enjoying. About a year and half later, I lost all of my progress. Nordcurrent was wonderful in restoring my progress. To date, I have lost progress and least more than a half dozen times. Why - I don't know?????? Just last week, I took my computer to be serviced about these losses and it turns out my computer is fine. Currently, I am waiting for Nordcurrent to once again restore my progress. I have received several emails stating they are working on it. It appears since the beginning of losing my progress, it is taking Nordcurrent longer and longer to restore my progress. When you enjoy this game as a past time and have to wait days or a week to have your points restored, it becomes frustrating. This wait, however, does not discount Nordcurrent is a truly wonderful developer. I encourage anyone reading this to play the game for yourself.. love this game! Only thing that annoys me is the long wait for them to open a new cafe! i have completed all of them with three stars! Waiting patiently until they open another cafe! Update: This was my favorite game! Ive been playing for years. Completed all restaurants in all levels. Why does it take some long for you guys to open a new cafe? I'm really losing interest!. The game is really nice. I love this game. it's very very interesting I love this game and it is very amazing the game have many levels. It is really good game. I suggest you all please install the game and enjoy very much. It is my favourite cooking game in the playstore.I always wanted this type of cooking game but this game has a problem.Whenever you start this game with imternet you will have to play it again in internet.If you dont start game with internet, you cannot play it without internet.I hate this fact.Plz fix it.. It's an awesome game, great updates, the graphics are on point. This game never disappoints, I've been playing for five years and it just gets better. For any future updates, maybe the player can have a option of creating their own restaurant or shop and saling food, like they can choose what category does their shop/restaurant fall into: fastfood, seafood, pastries or full course meals. Something like that, it's just a suggestion.. This is such a fun game, I could stay up all night to play this. I love that if you need more coins to upgrade they give you 200 just to watch one add!!! I like how challenging it is, and you can even decorate your own restaurant. I definitely recommend.. its a sad truth that we can no longer play offline. i noticed people complaining about the \ud83d\udc8e. my strategy is this 1. i save about 50k coins and spend it in the casino daily. you get 12 gems everyday if you go to the casino and bet on the 500 coin slot. if you hit your 12 jems leave and comeback after 24hours! 2. log in everyday to claim rewards. 3. take advantage of holiday seasons for free gifts 4. you get \ud83d\udc8e when you reach a certain xp 5. dont buy every new restaurant or gadget.. Game started off very Fun and easy to play. Challenging but in a great way. Love all the new restaurant options. I hate that you took away the option of getting coins from each restaurant every 24 hours but I digress.. One of the best games ever, I 100% reccomend. I had one flaw, its difficult to get diamonds but I found that the way to do that is get interior upgrades. If you get enough experience you can open the casino and also get more diamonds. (edit: idek how but i have 350\ud83d\udc8e) I think when you delete the game it saves your progress in case you want to reinstall it, because i just recently reinstalled it and now i have opened a new restaurant. (it uses wifi) Again, I love this game and totally reccomend\u2755. I love this game. It is interesting. It gets tougher the harder you move .I really love this game it is a good app and completely safe and recommended for both alduts and kids. Ilove this game, it's so practical and fun. It's very addictive and I can't stop playing. I totally recommend it for people who enjoy cooking.. It's a good game, interesting, entertaining and it gets tougher when moving to the next levels. COMPLAIN I do not know why I cannot play it offline unless my data is on. Please I need your help", "neg_reviews": "SUPER fun game. BUT, it seems to be full of intentional glitches to prevent you from winning without upgrades. Also, it's impossible to earn gems naturally and you can't keep playing at a fun rate without them, which is obviously intentional so you money. So if you want to keep playing and not be super frustrated, spend a tar amount of money in their shop. Very disappointing. (I'm very good at these types of games, so I'm not writing a review based on frustration at my lack of capability).. A pretty fun game. Hard to get \"gems\" without paying but not impossible, just slow. The problem I have is that starting this week, ads have become far too intrusive. Went from having the option to watch ads to earn coins or a free spin at the in-game casino, to having to watch an ad after nearly every level. Often times, the ad that plays lasts longer than the level of the actual game. If you want to spend more time watching ads than playing games, this is the app for you!. I have been using (and been an ardent fan of) this game for over 3 years now. But lately, the number of (long, unskippable) ads has increased so much that it completely hampers the experience. Like seriously guys, 20-30 second ads every 2 levels? (For those who are not familiar with the game, each level lasts only about 2 minutes). I'm sorry to say I'm really disappointed. I would probably be forced to uninstall it soon if this continues.. Extremely fun and addicting, not impossible or frustrating like some. HOWEVER, gems run out very quickly after the first restaurant, and you need them to buy upgrades to move forward. So unless you want to spend (a lot of) real money, you have to grind A LOT to level up. They're extremely hard to get in-game. That part is very frustrating and an obvious cash grab. I do like the lack of ads, but a few would be worth it for accessible gems.. This game is really fun, but it's just way too hard to earn diamonds. I really think that you guys should add an update to this game where we could do minigames to earn diamonds or watch multiple ads just to earn even one. I'd rather watch 100 ads than having to play the same levels over and over just for 6 diamonds per level up. I honestly would give this a higher rating if it were easier to earn diamonds. This game is supposed to be fun and carefree, not so hard you wanna pull your hair out!!. It was fun until everything required gems to upgrade. And you can't exchange your money for the gems, they have to be purchased. And every little thing requires it, including opening new locations. It takes forever to earn 1 gem, and most things require 10 to purchase..it makes it to where you cannot even pass the levels unless you spend money on this stupid app.. Game is good but only thing is that you need diamonds to purchase almost everything! And they are very difficult to get unless you buy them. One has to play the same level over and over again to level up and get diamonds. Was very much hooked to this game but it gets very much irritating because of those diamonds. I am uninstalling the game as it is getting boring to play the same levels again and again for diamonds. You need to work on that. Plus there is frequent connection error!. This new update is terrible. They changed the characters and made them incredibly creepy and distracting. They look like characters from a horror film, like haunted dolls. I couldn't get through a single layer and I'm uninstalling. Other pitfalls include unskippable ads and a \"reward\" of useless coins when they play. I hate that I spent money on this game just for them to roll out such a horrible update.. I loved this cooking game however the recent update has saturated game play with ads. Without the option to skip it most of the time. Then they try to give you coins to \"reward\" you for watching, as if you had an option. This game is difficult enough to play without being forced to pay money. But the ads have pushed me over the edge. Please find a better way to incorporate the ads or atleast give a gem for a \"reward\" if you're gonna force your customers to watch ads.. It was fun and addicting until gems became an issue. I cannot get needed upgrades of any kind without gems, and the only way to earn them is to play levels for experience (slow or impossible without upgrades), or play a slot game with horrible odds of getting gems. What a waste of programming to put so much detail into a game and then make it unplayable. Why can't you just do an option to watch ads like all the other games rather than coercing players into buying gems? Truly Disappointing.. I used to love this game but will likely stop playing due to the new addition of obnoxious video ads that you can't always stop from playing. I've even had a few where the exit button isn't visible and every time you touch the screen to make it visible, you are automatically directed to the app store. Really annoying and running this game.. I love this game. I enjoyed playing every level especially the challenging ones. however, in order to make progress, you need diamonds which you can only get by buying them at unreasonable prices, leveling up (which is difficult as you go higher), winning tournaments (which is impossible and a rip-off). Uninstalled the game because the latest update has made it unplayable.. Have had this game for years. But stopped playing for a long while because there was absolutely no way to get more \ud83d\udc8e without either buying them, or leveling up- which can take a while. Beginning of game is fine, but after a little while you can't upgrade anything in a restaurant without them \ud83d\udc8e. Which is a huge bummer cause then you're left with mad customers or failing a level. I really wish there was more ways to earn the \ud83d\udc8e. Would love if something got figured out!. Edit Review: Lowering the rating to two stars because I was fine getting two diamonds everyday after playing everyday for 7 days. Now it went from 2 diamonds to literally getting zero diamonds after playing for days. I get 600 coins after a week of playing instead of diamonds. I have over 1 million coins but only 10 diamonds. There needs to be a better way to give us diamonds I get that y'all need to make money but it makes the game not fun and it makes ppl want to delete it :(. I loved this game and dedicated a lot of time and even purchased gems. I switched platforms for my phone and my progress was not carried over to my new phone. I sent an email with my old device ID and had saved over 1800 gems, and completed all the restaurants with 3 stars with the exception of the new restaurant and their response to me was that they couldn't do anything about it.... i am beyond disappointed. I really liked this games(I have had to it for many years) until the recent updates where they have added ads after ever level you play and the fact that it's a lot harder now to get diamonds. The ads only give you money. I really wish they would give you a way to earn diamonds. It would be nice if some of the ads that you have to watch to go to the next level you could earn diamonds. Also add an ad button for earning diamonds, even if it's just 1 diamond at a time.. I like this game but im giving it 2 stars because they dont give you enough diamonds which you need in the game to upgrade (its the main currency lets be real...), And i think that the challenges are rigged to be so hard they make you spend more diamonds (to upgrade stuff to pass the levels) than what you receive as a reward. And its so stupid that you have to pay diamonds just to do the stupid challenges. Yeah this game has potential but i dont think the developers really care.. Used to be a good game but now you can't win without upgrading everything to the max but they never give you enough diamonds to do that. You have to pay real money for diamonds in order to win. I spent $10 one night on a few hundred diamonds and it was only enough to get me to fully pass one restaurant. You would have to spend hundreds of dollars or grind for enough diamonds to 3star every level. That's dirty.. I've had this game since 2015. Ignored the fact that gems take so long to acquire and put in hard work. I ignored the fact that once before I had to start over after purchasing a new phone, after years of having the account and not being able to retrieve my old account. Recently there has been new upgrades with the graphics and the controls that were annoying at first are now worse. Even if an order is completed and given to the correct person, the tray will sit in mid air whilst time passes.. This game is a great concept and could be a great game....but everything is so over priced takes way to many coins and gems but has practically no chances to win anything. And then I have been working for hours to bet a level finally got it and then all the sudden can't connect to server and try again later. I don't mind spending money on a good game but every now and then you should be rewarded.

I have had this game sine I was seven years old and have loved it ever since. I love the variety of characters and the mystery of opening a booster pack. It would be nice though, if you brought back the Most Wanted pack for credits though, and make a variety of packs besides the bronze, silver, gold, previous challenge booster, and Nth Metal packs. Overall, the game is great and I love it!. It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.. Please update the game. So many opportunities to put in, so many bugs to fix. Please. Warner brothers has lost so many players because Warner Brothers has stopped trying. Devs need to do more about the hackers because they are out of control. Add more characters, more levels, take out microtransactions and replace them with credit buyables. If Warner Brothers has no clue what to do, then it should listen to the fans. I dont like telling people what to do but fans have been asking this for ever.. If I had to give this a rank, I'd say 4.8. This game is perfect for me but there is one issue that I hate. Online battles have some funny mixmatches, like when my whole Bronze team without any gear went up again Flashpoint Batman doing 72K damage, but I don't mind them, I actually find them quite funny, but the one issue I have is pressing a character to look at their gearcards, and then I can't press anything else. I always have to restart my game to play, and it sucks losing that energy.. This is a very fun and enjoying game to play. There are a lot of DC characters that are able to be unlocked and there are different versions of one character which I think is really cool. There are also a lot of different game modes to play and a lot of ways to upgrade your favorite characters. The only complaint I have is that depending on the phone you have effects the display on the game which is currently happening to me.. God, there's so much I want to say about this game. The graphics are so-so, but they still hold up. The combat is just like all the other Netherrealm games, and that's a good thing! I absolutely love the fact that the mobile versions and the console versions are connected so that you can get rewarded if you do something in the other. There's so much more I'd like so say, but sadly the characters only limit to 500. So I'll say this. 9/10. I DEFINITELY recommend! :D. I like both this game and it's sequel. I really liked being able to play Swamp Thing and some of the other new characters in Injustice 2, however it is just a little too complex for me. I also don't care the shard system in which the characters are bought. I like this one better in those regards and I like seeing more of the different else world and other comic versions of the heroes and villains.. Great game. Controls are sometimes interesting to use, gameplay is super fun, and the graphics are good for a phone game. I recommend it if you're wanting something fun yet addicting. The only problem I'm having with the game is that the longer I play the game, while I'm in a match the game will just close on me for no reason. I really wish this problem will be resolved in the future. Good game overall!. This game is amazing and the characters are awesome. their super moves are very cool. I like the game very much. but there is no gold Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) and there is no gold flash (like new 52 flash). so if this characters ara also added at the next update it will be more interesting and amazing. I request please added this characters.. I loved the game endlessly! I always used to play it a lot in my life. It's the Greatest fighting game I have ever seen! But l just wanna say that,when l faced the battle 62, the game stopped, the screen crushed like nothing started! And that battle left undone. I just wanna know the reason of it! Could you please fix this problem?. Please please please keep the game alive WB. This game is amazing and has a plethora of great characters. Ita so fun to play as your favorite hero or villain progress. Dont stop updating this game. It's better than mortal kombat and by far the best mortal kombat ish game on mobile devices. Being a huge fan of the game I can confidently say this game is also better than the console version. Why? Because the mobile version has more characters and adds more simplicity to it all.. In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.. A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.. I love this game! The graphics are amazing the gameplay is good and I love the that the creates added metal packs and metal characters. The only problem that could be fixed in this game is all the hackers in online that's pretty annoying and I've been playing for years and I do wish that they would bring back the most wanted pack and you could buy it with credits instead of 40 dollars. But other than those things I love this game.. Love it. But please make the blocking faster. When I'm fighting CPU for some reason. When they hit me, I never have time to block, unless I do it before. But when I use heavy or light attack and hit the enemy, they instantly block and keep hitting. It really annoys me and makes it harder.. This is an incredible game that I just can't get away from. It's not like other games where you are forced to watch ads to do anything, so that's a huge plus. I can never get bored of this game and I'm in love with the character designs and the graphics and everything about it. There is a power system, stopping you from playing for hours and hours, but I like it because then I can get out and do things, instead of being a couch potato. Thanks for creating such an amazing, fun, game!. This game is epic I love how it is offline because all offline games are soo boring unlike this one. I think there needs to be an update and include more player though. On my tablet this game is perfect but on my phone for some reason after I've played a battle it goes off the game and into my home screen so I never get my XP and have to do the fight again but it still takes my energy bars and the process repeats so I dont move on. Please help me fix this. Cool game... -Years Later- Ok so I've been playing this game for about 5 years and I made this review in 2018. I love this game! it's just so OG and whenever I play it, it gives me big nostalgia. The graphics are really good for a type of game like this, it's amazing. Thank you NetheRRealms for this game, Bye now.. I played both games 1 & 2. They have always been with me for a long time. Though since injustice 2 is ridiculous when it comes to obtaining characters, even having gems doesnt give u an edge, i wouldnt recommend injustice 2 to anyone. Cuz it is too frustrating to put too much effort and then not pay off in the end as hoped, even though their support team are saints. The game is just unreasonable. Injustice 1 is perfect when it comes to everything. I switched back to 1 afterwards\ud83d\udc4c. This game is actually insane. I mean first of all it's offline, so you can play anywhere and everywhere. The mechanics are incredible, casting you into a 3v3 combat game, with fast-paced fighting and action, similar to Mortal Kombat. The game devs are exceptionally creative and talented and this game is wholeheartedly worth 5 stars.", "neg_reviews": "I like this game, good graphics, what not. But what I find frustrating is the difficulty of the game. I saving my mobile data, so I play the levels. The levels are hard. I I'm not those people that uses money so it is difficult to get characters. Please tone down the difficulty. I literally a very hot head person. When I lose SO many times, I throw my phone across the room. Please tone it down\ud83d\ude43.(Edit: brought down two stars because of hackers in the game. Full nth metal characters but level 10.. Unfortunately while I used to say this is one of the best fighting games on mobile that is no longer possible because it is no longer possible to play the damn game. The app frequently crashes a second or two after opening. There seems to be no pattern to it. Every time you try and play its a lottery whether it's going to work. No amount of restarts, clearning cache, clearing data, or any other solution has helped. Please fix this Netherrealm.. Ever since the new update the app is crashing just after I finish a win. Don't even get points for those wins. Please look into it. Today while playing against a metal Shazam whose life was almost over. He became invisible and started beating all my Arkham knight team. My hits fell on air but their hit kept coming and I lost. What's wrong with the game. Ever since the update every thing is going haywire. This week didn't receive any rewards in weekly online even though I was in the top 2 percent. 2020 yet I'm still waiting. I have years playing this game within different devices and accounts. Its a very addicting game except it needs better graphics. I'm now playing on a Samsung note 10+ and the game can't even take up my full screen because of how old it is. There are so many awesome characters atm but I've seen much better before and its very sad they were temporary. If only we can get a chance to collect all of them every now and then. This game really needs one last touch, PLEASE.. As a game, it's actually really good. It runs pretty well even on my phone which is pretty old. Graphics, gameplay, all good. But my god, the customer service and customer satisfaction is APPAULING. It's as though NRS and WB don't think of people as people, but instead as walking ATMs. And that wouldn't even be too bad seeing as how that's the road all businesses are taking now, but at least moderate the damn online servers and keep the hackers out you lazy, money grubbing seals.. I used to love it and was grinding in it aswell, now after reaching a high stage in the game it doesnt open anymore,no issue from my side .. The game just wont work.Fix this issue as I want to continue playing. I have veiwed other comments,most stating the same issue .. Now either everyone one playing the game has bad devices/internet or its the game!This is turning to a trash game!.This game has becime really bad and slow.Fix this issue! I tried reinstalling it multiple times.Fix the game!. I spent many many hours playing this game then I got a new phone and it wouldn't let me transfer my account over!!! I tried everything possible to link the accounts but nothing works, dont waste your time like I did on this game. i used to love this game so much but then a stop playing for a while and when i started playing it again it kick me out of the game. i tried to get back in but it kick me out again after i finished a match, but worse of all it doesnt count the match and i played the same macht all over again. Please fix it, thank you \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e. and older game and it really shows. i've played this game for years and instead of fixing current bugs or just quality of life improvements they introduce new content, which is great, but with said content comes a boatload of new bugs. i can't count how many times i've lost a match or series to infuriating bugs or bad design that i can't do anything about other than watch my characters die.. I'd like to say this is a great game, but after playing for a few months. I can't play the game anymore, like when I clicked on the game. It only shows a blank screen with \"Injustice Android\" on the top left. After a few weeks, I thought it will fix it itself. But it still the same. I'd like to give a 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Edit 1: I REINSTALL ON A DIFFERENT DEVICE AND I LOGGED IN MY DG OR SUMTHIMG AND MY HEROES ARE ALL GONE \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02. There's a bug where whenever I play a match and finish the match I will get kicked out of the application. I think it has something to do with the phantom zone update. Everytime I click the phantom zone, the \"help\" button glitches and there's a % sign Infront of the \"Help\" button. I press back and I'm stuck on that page. Deleting the app and reinstalling it doesn't fix this bug either. I'm annoyed at the fact that I won't be able to receive the rewards from the online battles due to this bug.. What happened to Breakthrough?? And who keeps removing my comment? Whoa... Beware of this game. Do not even try to begin playing this game. This game is very, very expensive. Beware of all NetherRealm Studios games. You will be upgrading for years, and you will be forced to pay to win here. No, I'm dead-serious. Do not download this game. It is outrageously expensive here. $99.00 usd for characters, and you will have to buy it 4 and 5 times.. Idiots keep resetting all progress made in the game. All levels locked forcing me to start at the tutorial but the game won't unlock anything now. This is the 3rd time this has happened & the developers continue to say they don't know what happened & are not able to fix it. I'd like to give it 0 stars but am forced to give at least 1 to post a review.. The fact that I lost my entire account during a data transfer is ridiculous. Is common sense that I click on my account that I want to transfer but instead, it overwrites with a new account and I lost every character that I work hard grinding. Great job WB, something as simple as transferring data can be screwed up. I'm done with this game.. (January 2020) - Same problems. Still not fixed. (December 2019) - Ive been playing this for quite sometime now. The purchase are too expensive for a mobile game. And recently Ive been experiencing bugs with the Flash (Earth 2) whenever his passive triggers. The screen goes crazy. And with Batgirl (Arkham) that whenever she uses her first skill, she sometimes just kick from a distance (so technically it does nothing) instead of throwing bombs.. i really liked this game its amazing, but recently it became unbearable not because anything other than the company greed . YOU CAN'T BUY ANYTHING WITH COINS, you have to pay money in order to do nearly anything in this game . so i think im going to uninstall it , im not willing to pay and im not going to go anywhere in the game without paying so , whats the point of playing.. Everytime new update comes along and i update this game and open it, the opening cinematic plays right but then the menu is totally blurry and unrecognizable. This is probably because it was made for much older devices and WB doesn't want to spend any resource on upgrading it to current systems. Also the ingame items are priced astronomical. WB is probably gonna let it go on and collect as much cash as possible before pulling it off the store. This is why you don't get any replies from them.. This game is great and all but the game is already hard with the bots having always blocking its almost impossible like they already have health and power that no one could ever get which is unfair unless they are bosses and it should be like that but the bot you play against always block if you are very far in the game.. Only goal of this game is to take your money. Towards the end, characters you fight against get way too strong, and you have to spend real money and months of time playing it constantly to possibly finish it. You'll often play the same mach over and over again because it rewards you a lot of money you need and it gets boring fast. Don't play it, you'l just get frustrated and lose real money.. very fun at first as a beginner, but the more you progress the more hard it gets and it comes to a point where you are *required* to buy someone high level but with the amount of money you get, its literally impossible if you wanna play the game for free, when you meet black adam thats where it gets unplayable", "pos": "Negative reviews:\n- Players request for more variety in booster packs and elimination of microtransactions.\n- Complaints about game bugs and crashes during battles.\n- Frustration with imbalanced multiplayer mode due to Nth Metal characters.\n- Issues with unresponsive touch controls, particularly when viewing gear cards.\n- Display issues on certain phone models affecting gameplay.\n- Desire for additional characters like Gold Green Lantern and Flash.\n- Complaints about hackers in online battles.\n- Difficulty in blocking attacks during CPU battles.\n- Frustration with the inconsistency of the game closing during matches.\n- Injustice 2 is criticized for being too complex and frustrating in character acquisition compared to the first game.\n- Desire for faster blocking mechanics in battles.\n- Some players experience game crashes", "neg": "Users find the game frustrating due to its difficulty level, especially in terms of challenging levels and the need to spend money to acquire characters.

Been playing for years and I always install on new devices. Music is hot, nitro is burning, and although the game has been out for nearly 5 years now, the multiplayer base is very much alive. In my opinion, this game supercedes even the latest addition to the series, Asphalt 9. Edit: One year later and this game has devolved into pay-to-win. Henceforth I'll be playing solo and career races where I can enjoy driving and racing without the pressure of winning.. This game is so awsome for 3 reasons. For 1 when there is a problem with like an event or something and your not able to get the reward they give somthing else. 2 The graphics are good. 3 they have alot of cars some are good some are bad but mostly good cars. There's so many modes and task to unlock rewards .I've played this game for a long time and it gets better and better. I am not a robot. So yeah that is about. Oh almost forgot some cars are very exspensive. The best asphalt game ever. The replay value is through the roof fun. I can't mention a moment were my heart wasn't pumping racing other cars in new races. The music is awesome and inspired me to make my very own Asphalt 8: Airborne playlist. I work hard for my credits, never once I.A.P. for my credits or tokens (which I probably will at some point... maybe). I love the new showdown event. It should be incorporated into the champaign season or multiplayer. Keep up the great work.. Fantastic game for playing. The only problem is cost of the cars and bikes is higher than previous years. Please make the cost of bikes and cars rate down because they are so expensive. So we can buy the cars and complete collection .I love the graphics and controls .Festival season is very good for buying any class cars . Keep going Good game. Wow! It's a really amazing and wonderful racing game! It's the most best game for me. Infact there is a pickup truck (which I am really confused why it's there). But the game is awesome! It has top class graphics and real cars with the real company logos on them! Full Five star!!. if you want an amazing racing game on your phone, or just an amazing game in general, get this game. even if you take away the visually stunning graphics and the fact that it is one of the few games that work with joycons, it is still an exciting and awesome game with tons of different cars and tons of different ways to play. also it is unique In the fact that it has ingame currency that is actually achievable without spending three years on a tedious task just to get one. thank you for this.. One of the best graphics action racing games,i ever played. The graphics are awesome. Look,we little people can pick the little bugs in this game only when we can fix that by ourselves. It is a great project.little bugs can exist,no doubt. Some problems have come. 1.) My coins are turned into negative numbers. I can't buy anything now. 2.) My all owned cars are missing now.. 3/13/21 Solid five stars, I love this game, I've been playing for years now and it has never fails to get better and better. I just updated the game and I saw that the free festival event doesn't give us even one car anymore, while the premium one gets 5(B, C, A, S, S class). Don't get me wrong, I everything else is fine but can we get at least one car, please. 11/24/21 what happened the the car mastery race option, I was looking for it but I can't find it.. This is probably the best free racing game on the play store. I would even say it's better than most payed racing games. The controls are great with a large selection of styles to pick from, the graphics are stunning for mobile, and it runs really well for how good it looks. Only downside is that progression can be pretty slow at times, replaying the same races constantly to scrape credits together to unlock new races. I would recommend this to anyone with even a slight interest in racing games.. This is an amazing game but most of you don't understand. You don't have to download the races. Just wait til you have WiFi and enter the app and then will auto update. The cars have high prices so you always have a goal. You can spend years on this game. Sure more money would be nice but suck it up and deal with it. My only problem is the Lamborghini Asterion is impossible to win by ad but it's still an amazing app. The graphics are amazing and the controls are easy. Thank you Asphalt 8!!!!!!!!. This is a fantastic game to play, top of the range graphics and visuals. I've been enjoying it for a while on woofer and bass, and it just gets better with time! I even progressed a couple of ranks and bought several vehicles, including motorcycles. It saddens me that I have to uninstall this game to save space on my phone \ud83d\ude2d I'll have to try a smaller game, like asphalt xtreme. I'll play this game again if I buy a new phone. I thoroughly enjoyed the motorcycle driving and the multiplayer races!. 1 of the best racing games I've played on my phone. Great graphics, control's, spectacular sceneries, fabulous cars to drive fast with and do tricks with. Sometimes there is a little bit of a lag with Multi player load screens, and doing the free videos for items. You guys need to bring back the rest of the car's so I can add them to my collection.. It's a cool game and it runs smoothly during races but it takes forever to load the rest of the features like modifications, features, and the downloaded content for the quick races. I have a cheep phone running it, though. I don't even have service and I have to run on free WiFi, so it's may be my problem and not the game. I really like it, the pros outweigh the cons. Thanks for your hard work Gameloft!!!\ud83d\udc3f\ufe0f. This is honestly the best racing game I've ever played. I uninstalled it, redownload it, and now I'm sure I'll never uninstall this game. Graphics can be better, but that shouldn't be a concern. I love all of the challenges, limited time events, and all the things you can do. And, there's a whole bunch of cars and my favorite is the Lykan Hypersport because it's my dream car but anyways I will definitely recommend you racing fans this game.. This game is is good, Very good I like the graphics and the racing. It also has good handling so you can win the race it is kind of hard at the same time because you crash a lot but it is still the best game. Also it could need some upgrades because like sometimes bugs and stuff like that. Also it lags when you go to the next car because there's a lot of cars. But it's a good game!!!\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01. Dude this game is amazing, extremely addictive and the graphics are unbelievable. very well done, lloking forward to seeing more games like this. the only thing i would make a suggestion about is the multiplayer, should group the races by class and rank would make it more interesting and a little easier to get the goals. Really enjoying this game. Maps and graphic are so great. It's not completely p2w game so it tries to be fare with all the players. Also love the fact that this game doesn't follow to rule of having limited fuel. So u can play all day instead of waiting for fuel like all the other games.. Just amazing game due to background music in the race, and the cars in this game is amazing. Even graphics is not normal, it is beyond the normal and solid. So please play this game so amazing. And yeah not only cars, even bike racing is also there but you will get it when you reach specific stars. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01. Best game. Best graphics. Very fun to play. \ud83d\udc51 Of games. Very realistic. Multiple racing modes. Very easy to play. Controls are very easy . Other games controls are to complicated. I recommend playing in laptop/PC. Graphics in Nvidia GeForce is awesome. Many cars. Many tracks. Cars are awesome. The challenges are easy to play. The game is Intuitive. Multiplayer mode is awesome. But you cannot pause in MP. Anyone can play. Great job Gameloft! You never want to stop playing this game. Very Good !!. Asphalt was my past years summed up. I had been on this game for a long time and it never lost that enthralling sensation of driving. I love the wide variety of cars, which is the main reason this game never dies. The graphics are unreal and what suprises me is that even my amazon fire tablet can run it. The multiplayer is really good, but I dont like the aggressive players (not that there is anythimg that the devs and do something about it). Nice game, and i love the compensation system.", "neg_reviews": "I played 10 World Series Classic Season races and didn't receive the Elite League reward of 25K credits and 180 Badges. Such a lazy, boring, untrustworthy game this is. Play Store Team should ban such apps from Play Store. I WANT MY REWARD OF 25K CREDITS AND 180 BADGES.. SEVERAL ISSUES WITH THIS GAME - I keep getting this error message just before launching any race (Error 0-0-14). - Many a times you have to play the advertisements more than once. Now both these issues have been happening from a while now. RIDICULOUS & EXPENSIVE CAR PRICES. It used to be such a nice game with reasonable car prices. Please go back to your old car prices or atleast make it REASONABLE not crazy expensive. PLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES ON PRIORITY. New multi-player sucks!! I have only won once out of over 5 dozen attempts. Used to win or place 2nd on numerous occasions. The new format makes it impossible. Used to love playing this game...until they added all of the ads that pop up when trying to start a race or navigate to different screens. Its exhausting now...considering deleting app if the frequency of ads doesn't go back to how it was before. I don't mind an ad here and there, but not everytime I try to select something.. It time for me to leave. I do not believe the issues in this game will ever be fixed. I also have no intention of moving to asphalt 9 as I do not like the card format of getting cars. Thank you for the fun you have given me and goodbye. Issues I Have: Highly unstabe multiplayer, a bad match making system designed to make you lose races (ie. Racing cars with +100 rank on you) and too many currencies (Would be better to just have coins and the premium currency).. I used love this game with a passion, but ever since the fusion points update, the game hasn't been fun to play. I used to buy tokens somewhat frequent, but now there is no motivation to do so. If you would like to play this game, do so at your own sanity because you are constantly being bombarded with in game purchase offers and a game like this isn't fun if you can't grind. This game used to be free to play, but now it's pay to play. The \"Free\" download button is a lie. RIP Old Gameloft.. The game itself is well made with nice graphics, controls and a huge variety of cars. Marketing this game as free to play is nothing more than a blatant lie. I have been playing the game with the same car for about a season and a half because saving up enough in game currency for a new car that is actually viable is not possible. I have also been racing this 1104 ranked car against 1250 ranked cars because the upgrades are expensive. Of course, if you spend LOTS of money all these issues go away. the gameplay is really good, but there are a lot of problems in the organisation of the game: it's more pay-to-win, the prizes are lower than years ago and the costs are too high. The festival is ok, but the cars you can win are too bad in performance. Also with new anniversary festival both problems show up, as you can only pay to win cars. The multiplayer mode is really bad, with many bugs and cheaters. Please fix these problems, because this game deserves so much!. This is a great game, and I have played it for years, and then a serious problem arose. I had advanced far into the game, and for whatever reason, I lost all the progress I had made, I was moved back to the start, and my credits went from plus 900,000 to a MINUS 900,000. I contacted customer care, they sent me a form letter with useless information. Many players have the same problem with the same useless information. You can YOUTUBE the negative credit problem and see the same results. I uninstalled it, and reinstalled it but I always had the minus 900,000 credits. Beware of 'that'.. new update simply sucks. It takes forever to load challenges and multi-player option always showing \"updating \" message. Blueprints are always synchronising and things that are to be connected to the internet for playing doesn't load, fix this.... Previous version was very smooth, if this remained like that I would've given 5 stars.. The game is good and all but only in singleplayer, when it comes to multiplayer the game is unfair and I don't know why but when I try to do event multiplayer races I get disqualified as soon as the race starts please fix that and also the unnecessary wrecks in multiplayer as well I can go crash into some other person multiple times and they won't get wrecked but if they even touch my car it just gets wrecked. Too many ads now and due to this the boosters get wasted sometimes. Dear, Gameloft developer, we would like to suggest this game to make it better. So here are the updates to make the game better. 1. Remove fusion coins. Reason: Some or half of the people playing this Cannot afford to buy fusion coins. 2. Decrease the value of the Cars and upgrades into 70%. Reason: Most of the people playing this game is having a hard time Earning money compared to the past. Especially beginniners. that's why most people is hating this game. Thank you. For reading.. This game is being milked like a cow with ads. I used to play this game when it was in its prime. Lots of good cars have been removed. The quote 'you either die a hero or love long enough to see yourself become a villain' hasn't been truer. The best version of this game was 3.0.0. Was and I mean was the best driving game out there but come on Gameloft you really are letting your long serving customers down. I used to play the game daily without fail but since the last update it's been locked on 75% downloading for the past 4 days now and I am not uninstalling and reinstalling it as I know full well I will lose all of my progress and car collection. So what is going on are you actually going to fix it???????. Graphics are nice, soundtrack is repetitive and the fact that I have to play one stage a good 30 times just to get enough money for ONE UPGRADE makes me hate the fact that this is pay-to-win. With 3 in-game \"currencies\" it is very hard to argue that the game is fair for \"free-to-play\" users because it's not. If you have no life and no money... This is the game for you \ud83d\udc4d. The game is really fun, but it is so buggy that it's unplayable. I can't upgrade my cars, because it keeps telling me there's a network problem. When I finish an event, it tells me there was a problem uploading the results. So basically I'm completely unable to progress at all. Odd, since the network works well enough to dish up a new ad at every opportunity.. Well I've given it a chance but I just can't NOT change my previous review. I'm sure people have heard the phrase\"If it's NOT broke DON'T try to fix IT!\"Well Asphalt 8 WASN'T broke(UNTIL THIS LAST UPDATE)so WHY did the developers TRY TO FIX IT! For example..my game NEVER FROZE UP in the middle of EVERY SINGLE RACE until NOW!!Long story short...I'm deleting the app after I send this because the game\"SUCKS NOW!!\"More time for\"Real Racing 3!\"Wow I sent this message BEFORE I read the other reviews!. The game overview, graphics and user interface is extremely appreciable, but, the overall review after the new update is TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING. I literally stood near the WiFi router for better range and still I am disconnected from the Multiplayer Server. This has to be solved ASAP by the developers. When I see other reviews, I understand it's not just me who has this encountered this issue, more players has enough similar and good points worth highlighting. I expect the Gameloft developers take this issue seriously. Though I'm not a regular player, I literally like this game. So i humbly request the developer to resolve the issue we face at the earliest. Thank You !!. Reached the final season in this game. It's complex, unfair, stressful & frustrating. Cars have become expensive and the income rate has been drastically reduced, watching advertisements eventually becomes necessary. A new currency and a new multiplayer mode has been introduced, making the game more unjust & complicated. To progress, you have to watch a ton of advertisements and buy a lot of slow cars or spending real money is always an option.. Pay to play game. It's fun at first but as you progress it becomes very very hard to clear chapters which will need a powerful high tier car to complete, which is almost impossible to buy unless you spend real money. I'm not surprised though, almost every game is designed to trap players and force them to spend huge amount of money, if they do, sure they can play further if they can't, they get frustrated and uninstall eventually, just like me lol Don't bother if you can't throw lots of \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0. Era of free games=no fun. A trap not a free game. They use nasty tricks to push you to keep spending real money, by making you lose no matter what, by their worst multiplayer points system. If you win you get 1 point and if you lose you lose 30 points. The unfair matchmaking, I think it's not real people but just computer AI in the multilayer. The cars stats aren't real. They nerf good cars bought for real money with the compensation of 30% virtual money. Upgrade costs (400%)are disregarded", "pos": "Negative reviews:\n\n1.

Very quick transactions. It did take me I while to get my account set up because of the level of security, which I took as I good thing as it gives you confidence that your money and cryptocurrancys are kept very safe.. This app has made leaps and bounds over the last year. The coinbase card and direct deposit are welcome bonuses. My only complaint is the absurd trading fees but that is not an issue as they allow you to move fiat and crypto between this app and coinbase pro at no fee. Coinbase is leading the pack for now.. Edit: because this review sounds a little cheesy let me start by saying I was not compensated in any form and this is still how I feel, 2 years later... I have not made a withdrawal or \"cashed out\" but for purchasing the available crypto currency and transferring funds this app is beautiful. Very easy and fast for transactions, everything is there for you and easy to use. I would highly recommend this app for anyone looking to invest or trade.. I don't understand why there's so much complaining in this review section. This app has worked flawlessly for the past 4 months I've been using it. Adding payment methods and verification of ID was simple and took just a few minutes. Fees aren't too bad and I've really enjoyed the notifications I get about my crypto price changes. I highly recommended Coinbase!. Super superior when it comes to buying, trading, selling Cryptocurrencies! Absolutely recommended and they will show you all about how to use the service. Every single block chain of cryprocurrenxy being mined. Daily updates on which coins are up or down. I just wish I had known about this much sooner. Now is the time to invest in your future. The future of money is indeed through Digital Currency.. Great app if you're new to Bitcoin or like to gamble which crypto is going to do well. Timing is everything, though. It was better when they had crypto you could earn by watching an informative video about whichever crypto and earn somewhere between $3 to $10 for answering a few questions about what you learned. I'm not sure if they still do that, but you can still earn interest over time with certain cryptos by staking (investing) money into them. All around, it's a good app.. Everyone should visit: (CNNTRADE. COM) to register the best EX changes. It's good, fast withdraw... This is the worst app I have EVER installed. Password issues were insurmountable. I would meet the criteria for the password. Password is received. Once I try to log in after leaving the app( Coinbase) the password is invalid. The is NO ONE speak to about this issue. Only a computer generated chat that gives computer generated replies. easy to use, easy to add funds/ transfer money, convert one crypto into another. send crypto to friends, plenty of opportunities to earn free crypto (which you can then convert into whatever you want). The most frustrating part is the market itself. this is a great app for anyone of any experience level and after a while, if you're not experienced, the simplified UI and app design will make it easy to pick up the ins and outs of crypto and the related market.. Seriously a great option for anyone new to the crypto markets. Easy, fast, secure, and also customer support is great. MY ONLY ISSUES is the service sometimes will be down for a few minutes or hours, sometimes it will come back and work partly, sometimes You will have to just wait. And the updating of real time prices and your funds is sometimes a tad slow. But otherwise 9 out of 10. 100% the best crypto app. Trust the reviews guys, lots of them out their, but coinbase king! \ud83e\udd34. I gave this app five stars it if there is more than five star I will give it but there is little observation on the app if you can correct will appreciate 1. The limit that you are giving us is very low 2. You have to correct your customer support 3. Sometimes the app is very slow 4. Increase some of the features eg payment methods for us in Nigeria. Everyone should visit: (CNNTRADE. COM) to register the best trading platform. It's very good. Coinbase is okay for someone looking to dollar cost average into some popular crytocurrencies; however, this App seems to alway be unavailable during periods of extreme price swings. I have experiened this several times in the past two years; however, two recent examples are April 29th and this past Saturday, May 9th. Very frustrating when you want to take advantage of big price swings. to be honest, I like how coinbase explains more thorough on what you're getting into and it just don't throw you into something you're unsure of. I saved a lot of money and learned how to invest plus more. great app for beginners to experts. you can also send money from cashapp thru bitcoin; yes external addresses work and takes 10 mins or less depending on time of day and how good your data is.. Their charts are the best to easily look at the trend of a token. Also easy to link to your bank account to buy with fiat (or cash out to fiat). The only down point is they don't offer many of the alt coins I'm following (although you can still track those on your watch list in the app even if they aren't available to trade). Works amazing for me. I invest small amounts every payday, and hopefully by the end of the week I have a little to buy something I want. Super fast platform, although I wish when converting, the coin I'm looking at would be in the second spot instead of the first. Example: If I am looking at BTC and want to convert, BTC should be in the second spot so I can choose what to convert from, not too. lol hard to explain but I'm gonna leave it at that. I love it otherwise, and the card is insane.. It works well and is simple to use. Most of the UI is intuitive to use and full featured. I haven't found anything that I can't do he that I can on the website. The only \"downside\" is constantly having to re-authenticate, but since it just needs a fingerprint it's not bad. It might be extra security measures or it might be my VPN causing it, so it is fine either way.. I do absolutely love this app, but I feel that some features could be added.. for one thing, an option to see what my original purchase was and to be able to see how much I have profited or have lost by comparison. Other than that is great, just no stock options.. so much fun!. I recommend Coinbase to everyone. it's the Windows 10 of crypto. An experience that is easy to understand and has some options to dig deeper, but might be a little cluttered with things like self advertising and tutorials that an advanced used might be annoyed by, which I imagine is why Coinbase Pro exists. Which allows free trading between the two. a great service. Loving trading and tracking with this app. Seems the issues previously bothering me have been resolved. The only problem I still see is connectivity and updating - I frequently need to switch between LTE and Wi-Fi before my portfolio amounts will update. Connections seem to be a problem even when my phone is directly beside the router. Otherwise I am very happy with this app.. Well the app does lock up when searching cryptos, the no internet connection issue is caused by a poor connection even if you change networks, I was able to solve the problem by restating my phone and never had the problem since as long as I stay away from slow networks, and once in awhile the app will just close suddenly all on it's own, overall it does works.. Yes, it has it's issues. But if you rate coinbase anything less than 4 stars then you CLEARLY have not tried other crypto exchanges. This is the best and easiest to use. AND no monthly charge. I have tried everything out there, this is the best one there is. Perfect? No. The best?? Yes!", "neg_reviews": "Great potential, but the interface is lacking a way to track gains and losses which is kinda a big thing. Also, the fees are very unattractive, to the point where I've begun shopping for a different crypto platform. A $3 per trade is a joke. I understand they may be trying to raise capital quickly, but right now they're poised kinda like Robinhood; a great way for investors to dip their feet, but in time investors will find themselves wanting a tried and much more fee-friendly crypto platform.. I really liked this app when I downloaded it, I have recommended it to friends and coworkers but now it continues to crash repeatedly!! I close every thing out, try to open the app and it takes forever. I was in the middle of a trade when it crashed this time!! Ugh!! If this doesn't get fixed I will have no choice but to move everything to another app..... Please, Please fix this!!!! Thanks.... Stay away from this App. I haven't been able to take any \"lessons\" due to \"connection issues\". As well as having the \"connection issue\" pop up while buying cryptocurrency. If you hit the retry button while buying, you will end up buying more than you originally wanted. The app is broken for sure. The connection issue is with the app, not your phone, so don't listen to them and restart the app or your phone. It does nothing.. I've had no issues with the app itself. The problem is how they upcharge every transaction plus charge a fee. Ex: I just bought 5 coins that show 12.90 per, they charged 12.98 per. I went in and out several times, it was not jumping that high. If you convert one type to another it says no fee, but the conversion is 100% not giving me full value. I get that you need to charge a fee, but put it all up front, don't rip off fractions of $ on top of it. Wish I could trust this company, I dont.. TNT: Hello all, this the first time that I am rating on here. Cut to the chase, I'm noticing a lot lately that the biometric scanner is running slow or it isn't working majority of the time and as well as the the pencoode to login. Not, sure if you're squad is aware of this but it has been happening quite often. Update: Still doing it!... Update: Now I have to sign in all over again why, when I have been on your platform for a long time now.. Yikes! Most recent update is very bad. Constantly giving me the \"error occurred\" screen and telling me to connect to the internet, even though all other apps are functioning and connection is stable. Also, they have removed search function (or made it so hard to find that I have not been able to locate it) so don't bother trying to look up stats for coins you don't have on this platform. Consider another app.. Beyond poor customer service. Debt card got deactivated without warning because of suspicious activity (I was using to make large purchases, totally understandable). I couldn't get any help to reactivate my card. Despite being a Coinbase One subscriber. All the support call center does is escalate the ticket and you wait for 72 hours to get a response by email. If they even respond.. Was a good app until the most recent update. Recently with this new update things have took a rather negative turn. First I would like to address some incredible lag that started with the update. Every time I click anything it takes way longer to load than it used to, feels like I'm waiting for a video to buffer. Second, they completely ruined charts by squishing them flat to the top of the screen with no way to adjust back. The charts look flat and seem like there is little to no movement.. This app used to be great. The most recent updates, however, make it impossible to use the app without getting frustrated. I have great service and wifi but I still have \"connection issues\" constantly. FIX THE APP. Idk what you guys have done, but im not the only one experiencing this. Don't tell us to \"check our connection\" or \"restart the app\". This is on your end.. So unprofessional! This is the worst design ever, designed to mislead and hide the importance! No options to change any view settings, useless screens, so unprofessional! Hate this app more with every update! Absolutely useless! Many bugs and so poor data presentation! No custom alerts, this app is intentionally made to be bad. Very high fees!. I put in money using suggested method and cannot send for 8 days. I linked debit/credit card because it appears to be instant but limits to $50, which is not enough to send. If I would of known this I would have never even bothered. When I verified ID, the app told me it worked but it did not. I found out that it did complete verification but the app was unaware of it, just spinning blank page. I had to fully shut down the app and re-open app for it to work a while later. Coinbase is garbage.. Can't even sign up. Everytime I try to complete the two step verification that they require, it just says that it's either \"not found\" or \"already added to my account\". So it's impossible to finish. I have tried for a couple of days, so, if it's an app bug issue, let me know, and I'll try again later; otherwise, this app isn't worth it and you can just buy crypto thru PayPal and learn about it there too, as well as being easier to actually log into.. App seemed great to start with, but have now been locked out of my account for 2/3 months, raising the issue many times with the customer support, where they say that have fixed this issue but no luck. As the account still needs to verifying, I am unable to withdraw my funds. Great app when it used to work, user interface is nice and it's great for beginners. But I have now lost trust in coinbase so cannot recommend.. When the app works, it works well. But it works extremely inconsistently. The most frustrating thing is that I keep getting \"we're having connection issues\" messages at the busiest hours and also when coins I'm wanting to make moves with are getting a lot of attention. Which means, I can't buy, sell etc. anything while the crypto market is busy. Super frustrating! Looking for another medium. Coinbase causes way too much frustration, given it's platform.. I joined through the steady app for rewards. In order to get those rewards i have to watch learn and earn videos. I thought that was pretty cool since im actually interested, BUT when i click on them they say they are experiencing connection issues. It's been over 12 hours now. When i try to send a support ticket to customer support, it says i have to verify my email. When i check my email to get the code and come back (without closing the app), it resets the whole form and starts over. Its BS.. Over all a decent app but some issues. The fees are high for all but the most expensive trades. On top of that most other platforms have a much better GUI. For customer service, writing a letter would probably be faster and less stressful. This needs to change if coinbase is to continue being successful. Unfortunately they are doing the same BS as robinhood.... what a pile of junk.. I was extremely optimistic with my initial review of 2 stars which apparently disappeared or deleted. The app fails to initiate the camera even with appropriate permissions to verify your ID. The service continually seems to have issues and glitches out. The amount of hoops you have to jump through to utilize this service is insane. Edit: I'm currently in the process of getting out of this app. Coinbase is probably the worst experience I have ever had..

Edit: I'm currently in the process of getting out of this app. Coinbase is probably the worst experience I have ever had.. Junk app, 100% useless. It glitches every time I go to upload my ID to verify. I uninstalled and reinstalled (after attempting to update first). Same thing - it goes to previous page instead of uploading. I tried every possible thing on my end. Absolute useless, junk app until they can fix this. Good luck to you.... I've been trying for days to get this to work.

I have played other games of similar type, and I believe this is the BEST one among them. The developers actually listened to the feedback of players, which is different from many other games...And if you joined an alliance that is being stronger, you can have the fun of chatting with members and making it better!. events are fun and graphics are good. game is very fun, They add new stuff, like new monsters and events\ud83d\ude01. Fantastically addictive game. It is very easy to play. Easy to understand, but complex enough to challenge you. The little puzzle pin solving games are awesome and get more challenging as you continue. They're totallu not the main point of the game at all, but lots of fun. It's a strategy game based on resource gathering, troop building, Alliances, and war with other groups. So much fun! Very very addicting!! Only thing I would want to see added is requirements for items you can't use yet.. I really love this game and have been playing since it came out. Only issue is the server I'm on. The ratio of coiners to players without that ability is about 10:1. It's finally got to a point where if you aren't a member of one particular alliance you cannot progress. Long story short, this game is quickly progressing to soley relying on in-app purchases. Basically it is losing my interest particularly fast. My advice do not join server 29.. This game is so amazing, it is so much than I originally thought it qas. I thought it was a basic button pressing simulation game by which you make an army and just kill monsters... but you have a king/queen on the throne, you have to mine and build resources, train and upgrade your troops, build up your empire, and more importantly heal all of your troops, this can be done quicker with either gems \ud83d\udc8e ( that you purchase in the packages on offer- in game purchasing, or you can use speed ups). It's a pretty good game but I just wish they would fix there glitches for good stop Lagging so much. I don't normally like PVP but I still like this game with all the building and creating of my sert troops Etc. Good game, cost a lot to play. Only way to really grow in these types of games is to spend a lot of money.. I'm having alot of fun leveling up and receiving many gifts to open to use for material and upgrading. I'm addicted to this game. I may eventually buy the game pass for this stimulating game.. Surprisingly addicting! A rather far-reaching & often-complex game, but there are copious rewards and endless opportunities to interact with other players & alliances. Great job, Top Games!. Fun game, but learned reseaerch is more important. But they dont tell you this til after youve already passed that point.. At first I thought it wasn't something I would enjoy playing much, so I rushed into it without thinking. The key to this game is patience. It has a lot more mechanics than you'll expect so it's overloading for someone who is expecting a quick puzzle game. If you continue to play and explore the mechanics however, you'll find a fleshed-out game that can be competitive or casual, interesting and addictive all in the right places.. Fun! This is my first strategy game on my phone. I originally just thought it was puzzles (its ad/trailer is a bit misleading). That being the case, it's free, minimal ads, interactive and I've really enjoyed playing it over the last several months. It's pretty easy to get addicted to, but when the upgrades start taking a month+, it's easy to just check on it and still live life. Thank you to evony. Great game great time playing. Fun and exciting game.. Good game, if u found a great alliance, wish for the server to add some rules about range level for attacking the enemy. If u not there will be the decrease of player, expecially the new one. Im a 47 year old woman and i too initially went for the puzzles, and yes its not just a puzzle game. However, there is so much within the game to discover, the developers have created a mass of information that i am still finding. I have managed (through playing) to understand politics a little better.. go figure!. I've been playing for about a month or so. I was just expecting puzzles like on YouTube ad, but there's so much more to the game! I've found a great alliance to play with and help me learn and grow. You can definitely grow without paying for packs/gems, as long as you're in a strong alliance it's easy. On your own it is very difficult tho. The only thing that annoys me is the updates sometimes don't work smoothly for me. I've reinstalled the game twice because of this.. I also thought this was a puzzle game , but I fell into another world of Kings ,Queens and dragons !! I absolutely LOVE it !! I have been playing for almost two years now and I have made so many new players/friends from all over the globe. This is a strategy game so just remember not to spill the beans to everyone who befriends you !! ;)) I would suggest you join a big alliance to held you progress. I would give this 10* if I could ! I see others dissing the game and it annoys me as they've obviously NOT given it the time it so richly deserves!! Every game has it's glithches with updates so please be patient as the customer service team will eventually! Tip:- Keep reciepts if you are a coin player !!. I've been playing over a year and have something to share. The game has various development ways and you can grow big without investing. If you are active, you can grow fast in a big alliance. Our server is having svs with the server next to us. It's very interesting to fight a worthy opponent with almost same power. I like this kind of strategic game very much. If you like pvp strategy game, you might as well try it.. I recently updated this app, and now it keeps freezing up on me now. And also the top bar with the prosuction and gold income is not working. I'm getting no gain. When i empty the whearhouse, the production, and gold income always stays the same. Can you please fix this? Update: The developer was quick to fix my problem. It's a great way to pass some time. Thanks!", "neg_reviews": "If you're getting this game to solve the puzzles, know that you will be spending less than 1% of your time actually solving puzzles. The vast majority of time is spent building your kingdom. A more even ratio would be acceptable, but spending hours building your empire in order to spend several minutes solving puzzles, then spending a weekend updating your kingdom in order to spend several minutes solving puzzles, so on and so forth? Way overly complex and frustrating for my preference.. If you're tempted to download the game because of the puzzle, don't. The puzzles only have 17 levels. This is a war and strategy game not a puzzle game like the ridiculously misleading advertisement makes you believe. Do you like to play a game where you can't advance unless you spend a bunch of real money? Yes? Alright then this game is for you. You will constantly get cleaned up by people who spend thousands (yes thousands) on the game and can't do anything about it.. Expect to pay big $$ or wait forever to level up. I've spent a good chunk of change and it means nothing in this game. You wait a day or 2 for (some) resources to come back, it takes forever to level up without spending something. The game is fun though, certain events and some puzzles allow you to play without spending but you need a lot of patience (tons of patience) If you will not pay to play. (Evony- in response to your reply, I am in an alliance. You DO have to pay big $$$ to play.). I'm giving this 2 stars, on the basis that a 1* rating would be unfair since I've only given it ten minutes, but I did hate it. If I played for longer and wanted a MMO game, it may be OK. But... The advertising was for a pin pulling puzzle game, not a strategy / RPG MMO. That annoys me. If you want me to play your game, at least tell me honestly what it actually is. I'm not remotely interested in MMO games any more (been there and done it), so this was a complete waste of time and data. Deleted.. App needs update for Tab S8 ultra. The app jerks around if you try to quickly navigate the map to look for bosses.. Still Fraud. Their response is a canned response with nothing that addresses the fact that this game has you spending 99% of your time playing war. The puzzles are 1% of the game and yet every single ad you ever see are puzzles as if there were 100s of them for you to play. It is nothing like that. You build and build and build and you unlock a couple of simple puzzles. Entirely false if you think this is a puzzle game. Literally 1% of the game is puzzles. The ads don't show you what the game is. Don't waste your money. The lag, which is a non stop issue, will steal your goods. If you open a ticket, when they feel like getting back to you, they will not do a damn thing. So you will lose items regularly and the support will not do a thing about it. It is a fun game though. If they made it right, I would change my rating. But that's not gonna happen.. This is hilarious!! I see the advertisement on YT for this game. The ad explains that the entire game is problem solving the way it shows versus lots of puzzles with an occasional problem solving scenario. I believed that and immediately downloaded the app to find out. Guess I'll never know because it won't load. This is problematic with all these games. They develop a following and increase their capacity as the revenue streams build up; they quit adding capacity and fizzle.. Not what i expected. The puzzles, which they advertise like crazy are fun. The rest of the game for me is tedious and not fun. Tbh i don't even know what the heck is going on most of the time. Just clicking where it tells me until i get to the next puzzle. Maybe be more clear when advertising the game. Especially since there's A LOT of different ads for it.. This is a fun game for the first 8 levels. It keeps you occupied for a good 12-25 hours without paying, acting like you can progress consistently for the whole game. Once you get to levels 8-10 they require you to wait 2 hours-2 days to upgrade your buildings, etc. Now I can only upgrade one building at a time (level 10). The original add for a \"puzzle game\" which was originally advertised, is about 5% of the game. It incentivises you to eventually pay money for the game. Uninstall?. Giving this a two because I didn't get very far in the game. Promoted as a puzzle game, but is really some kind of strategy/city building game. I'm not interested in that kind of game, I really just want a game I can dip in and out off for short periods. I had zero idea what was going on and I found the text too small to read. I just followed the prompts until I got to the puzzles, but then they ran out until I level up. Willing to put the phone down while a few ads play, but not pay actual $$.. Update 5 Oct 2021: 10 months later, 1 ISSUE FINALLY RESOLVED! I can still only see one thread in my game inbox, (me asking for help about something else). The last thread had no reply for months. I wish I could upload a screenshot just of my inbox to show you how rubbish their customer service is. Current issue 23 March: updated app and now it won't open \ud83d\ude2d I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it won't open! Argh I don't know how long my bubble will last, I could lose everything!. Performance of the server is deplorable, freezes constantly. If run a rally, it takes my stamina then freeze and not join me to rally, so I would have to join again and have more stamina. Svs was terrible because I'd fight and it would freeze and I'd be burning when I came back on. Map rendering is terrible Half the time the map looks completely empty. You leave these issues because people will spend more money. Which means you're cheating people.. You misunderstood me, i don't care about the puzzles, I was playing Evony 11 years before we ever had the puzzles and if they disappear tomorrow it would not change the amount of time i spend on the game. I was just trying to help people with your misleading advertising about evony being a puzzle game. It's a war strategy game with a few puzzles as a bonus. The puzzles take less then a minute and sometimes you wont see any for months.. The undead event sucks. Its pure frustration. You have to heal your troops thrice for the same wave. You get hit thrice in the span of 30 seconds. The game performance goes for a toss. You have to logout login to the game several times during the event as the performance degrades and you cannot to anything. It will be one star from me until you guys fix this issue. This has been an experience for months now.. I'm frustrated. This game is so full of glitches. I've worked so hard to raise up my city. Exactly, at the beginning of killing event, the game became unresponsive. It took such a long time to put a truce agreement in place that meanwhile someone destroyed my city. I try to heal, but it won't happen. Pure frustration and disappointment. I'm not willing to pursue this any further.. After a week playing i have to change my review. The game is good. Slow advancing but still a good game. Problem is the devs do nothing to stop racism. The chat is insulting. And bullying is at an incredible level. The bullying is mostly done by one alliance that attacks daily against players that are not from their real life country. Maybe its just this server but its ruined any pleasure in playing the game. Its sad that the devs accept this behavior since the abusers are spending major $.. Fair game in the start but like myself got caught in an area run by 2 other alliances that bully everyone so your unable to advance as they constantly attack everyone even events you can't compete so I stopped spending money if your not Asian your nobody,game shows prejudiced players to Americans and Canadians, I don't advance anymore and stay bubble always so what a stupid waste of time now,really sad that your unable to leave server!. This game contains alot of glitches,I ones returned from other server after the battle,just after that I wanted to take truce to save myself from attack but as soon as I clicked to take a truce the app turned of and it shows connection problem,I lost all the troops and every resource,but what you did was nothing! And this not only my problem this happens with every second player, please compensate if the problem and updates appears from your side so that our precious time could be saved.. Top games have created an interesting, interactive, challenging and very addictive game. Unfortunately the great design is let down by slow running, lag ,app crashing and very slow to respond customer services. Unfortunately these constant issues seriously spoil the gameplay. I have raised several tickets regarding issues and they are all ignored, or met with a generic, unhelpful, unrelated response, copied and pasted from a collection of useless replies. 3 months later: still not resolved", "pos": "Players love the depth and complexity of Evony: The King's Return, highlighting the engaging gameplay that goes beyond simple puzzles.

Everything about the app is good. Did not like all the pop up ads so l got a quarterly subscription, takes away all that, works silently in the background to clean up your phone scan for virus and a good battery saver to. Subscriptions doesn't cost much. If you want a good virus and security app this is the one. Give it a shot and see if you like it.. This was amazing, it helped clean my phone of trash files that I didnt need. It didnt delete and photos of things that I wanted to keep so if your worried about it clearing your while phone don't worry it doesn't. It checked my phone to make sure it was safe. I really like it. It has a few adds but not to many, and not very long, totally worth it!. Good app! It helps me clean all the junk files and cool my device\u2019s temperature. I gave it 5 stars because it's a good app, and you should definitely try it. Some complains though, tons of ads are playing but good thing it isn't a video. But that doesn't matter. I know they have to make money for these app, but overall it's a good app and you should try it sometimes.. The best phone cleaner is right here. Its the only one ill ever need. Its great, seriously! it doesn't crash my phone like other browsers its free super easy to use reduces lag and lets you download more apps cleans your phone of junk files. Every one of them will be in the trash! Out of space? Say no more. Lagging? Just press 1 button and its gone. #notsponsored Edit: i downloaded this app about 3 weeks ago and i have saved 8.36 GB!. I LOVE this. The only bad thing is the amount of ads, but you can skip them and X out of them so they arent a huge problem. It cleans your storage, making you less laggy/slow. Royale high in roblox is close to not lagging at all for me, when it used to lag so much that I couldn't even play! This helped SO much. I totally recommend this! Thank you to the person that made this!. I love it,it helped me with space and keeping clean my iPad,it doesn't delete any of your games,it just helps with keeping clean and having space,you should download it if your having trouble keeping your phone or iPad clean and needing more space,but personally I really like it,I bet you will too if you try the app and it makes your device faster and it's much better than deleting apps. I just installed ONE BOOSTER and just after one use, my phone is running a whole lot better than before. I was skeptical at first but after seeing such an improvement so quick, all doubts are gone. The cool down is great and I don't have to worry about viruses anymore. This app is a keeper. I totally recommend ONE BOOSTER to everyone. My rating : 5 stars. \ud83e\udd29. This app really worked. A lot of things are offered free of charge, such as overall scan of the phone, which allows to see & then take care of temp files thru this app, but also showed me how much data I use on personal apps. Also, includes free features such as boosting phone's performance speed by stopping background apps, which I forget to do myself, plus helps from using up too much battery as well. Easy to use.. Absolutely great app! It got rid of the 27 viruses that I had on my phone, it tells me when my phone is getting hot and puts some of the apps asleep, when my phone is on charge, it tells me if it's slow charging. And hibernates some of the apps. I 100% recommend it! You don't have to buy anything!. Just give it a try if you not find it working with your phone then it's your choice to keep or not to keep this app . But for me it's like a life saver . Thanks to this app my phone is now better . Really really, thank you for this app \ud83d\ude0a.. This app really helps for cleaning out your unnecessary things. At first I thought it was a app that doesn't do anything at all but when I tried it; it's been cleaning and clearing so much storage. My phone used to be at 96% of storage but now it's at like 70%. I really recommend this especially when your on low storage or a game is kinda slow. (This helped my call or duty game). Nice app! it really helped me to clean the junk files and also mobile also get super hot and I realised that my phone is cooling down so that was my feedback hope it's useful.. Many phone cleaners charged people, but this one was free. That is a step in the right direction! It only takes one tap to get rid of unwanted junk, the app sends you notifications to clean your phone, and it can even help cool the phone's battery down! This is a great app and I highly recommend everyone who truly cares about their phones to download this!\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96. This is by far the best cleaner I have ever used on my Android. On two separate occasions I removed it and gone to a different cleaner only to come back to this one. I cleaned my phone with my old cleaner then switch to this one 10 minutes later and remove an additional 2.4 gigs of APK and junk. There may be ads but this cleaner is well worth it. I don't believe anyone with an Android will be disappointed. So far, so good. I would not use this app or any cleaner app as a replacement for an anti-virus/malware program. Also, pay for the antivirus program you choose because the free version won't keep you from being hacked or scammed. Otherwise, this is a good cleaner app to provide easy access to cleaning up your phone and increasing performance.. I am finding this application keeps me up with the regular times on fixing issues of my personal cell phones. Multiple things are checked. My needs with my cell phone are easy since the product is user friendly. It seems their software, I like it more each time when necessary. Thanks.. It's great it's fast and it's really works. I don't really like ads but the ones that you advertised on the app are really cool. I love this app because it cleaned out everything. Gave me more room in my phone I thought I had no more room in my phone and it just popped up and it made my life so much easier.. This app is amazing I love it so much because it really does cool down my phone, clean junk files and free up space, and it feels much faster now thank you very much for making this amazing app I really recommend it especially if your device is heating up, filled with junk memory, have a virus or many, or have a slow phone anyway I love this app thank you very much again, I totally recommend it!\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc4d. It has lots of ads, but it has helped by Samsung Galaxy A50 a lot. Sometimes it would get really slow when I'm making my videos, but I would just hit a few buttons and it would work as if its brand new. I really like this app and it helps me out a ton. So thank you whoever's made this, you have helped me out a ton! \u2764. Yah, it does pretty good, as an easy use cleaner & anti-virus scanner, but the Ads seem to be shown after every action, even tho they're short or can sped up to the end or just close it! They are popping up in my face just trying to traverse to the home page, after I just watched one for boosting, after just watching one for scanning, etc., etc.! I get that I am not paying for your Premium subscription, but I AM NOT RECIEVING ANY OF THE PREMIUM FEATURES, EITHER; SO, WHY DO YOU HAVE ADS\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4e!?", "neg_reviews": "Wow, after latest update it does nothing just says \"optimizing\" etc without telling you any actual measurable results plus even more ads. I guess you get what you pay for. Sad the only app like this that ever Truly worked was banned, Clean Master by cheetah mobile.. Unfortunately the free version do only light cleanings.I have couple more cleaner,free and paid. All the rest clean several hundreds of megabytes of leftover issues after One Boster clean the phone. What,I dislike on the free version,loaded with forced advertisements. Not only that the One Boster pop up almost every time you open any app on your phone and BLOCK YOUR APP ?! Also when you using any of you app's pop up on the top and disable the app in the midle of your using it!!. I haven't even used this app in over like 6 months of my subscription. ever since the day i asked for a refund because the bug that to this day never got fixed i hardly looked at emails back then but i dont think i ever had a response from dev. so going to go back to the other app i use to clean everything because it doesnt let me whitelist anything on this as it skips to the cleaning process and nowhere near does it come close to showing all my apps deleting app again might install again later.. I thought this app would be ok, but I paid for the premium, and had it for about 2 hours maybe, and every since then it's back asking me to upgrade to premium..I ALREADY DID, AND YOU AREN'T GIVING IT TO ME! It's just so aggravating, but you gonna take that next payment I bet..smh. My Android Coolpad was working tolerably well, but I succumbed to the, 'Keep up with the Joneses\" logic and signed up with One Booster and started loosing amenities within an hour. They mess with apps big time, including internet connectivity for my Google assistant and services. But, the worst part is, 'I CAN NOT DELETE OR EVEN GET EVEN WITH ONE BOOST. I should call them \"one BOOst\" for basically disabling my phone. Big promises, no delivery. Jerks! Within an hour of signing up, Boost said. I don't mind a few ads but last week has nothing but ads. So much so that I sometimes can't tap the action I want to use bc an ad has popped up. It's ridiculous that I also have to mute every single ad sound even if it's the same one over and over and over. I don't need a cartoon trashcan telling my memory is full when it's a damn lie. I thought ads like this were on the decline. Guess not. Bye One Booster.. Just doesn't do what it says it's doing. Said it cleared 7GB of app cache, which is ridiculous to even claim there could be that much cache that soon. 'Cleared' it in a matter of seconds and knowing what I know about these things I know that's simply unrealistic. So I checked my system storage settings and surely enough, nothing had actually changed. I didn't even have 7GB of free space so it was most certainly a lie.. LOUD, OBTRUSIVE, REPETITIVE ADS, literally over and over and over before you can use it to clean! Actually has an ad with a SIREN \ud83d\udea8! I nearly had a heart attack! Did they expect me to jump out of my skin first then want to purchase this? No way, IMMEDIATELY got a different app, left review, then DELETED! Also doesn't automatically scan new downloads or apps, blasts Ads before asking for permission to scan new app, most annoying 'free app' I ever had.. Edit: Do not download this! This App had constant notification reminders that would slow down my entire tablet and cause apps to crash!!! Several times this app told me that my phone was under threat and needed to be cleaned but never removed any files that could actually be seen. it's odd, I used to use clean master. But I tried to download that recently and it was not at all the same. Then I found this app and it's exactly like clean master used to be.. It is contantly popping up when im trying to do something, sometimes i can take it off sometimes it just starts to run on its own. I have to get out of what i was doing and start over. Very frustrating, i will be uninstalling.. App needs to stop lying to us, saying that they have cleaned out xxxx amount of MB or GB on our phone. I have been running this app daily because i use my phone heavily for work in communcation. Every time it says they cleaned up 300 MB, and ran it again in 30 mins or 1 hour it says cleaned \"300 or 400 MB\". My phone still shows the same speed when cleaned and closed apps. Please be accountable and actually clean the phone.. Use less I don't want to give one star also but it is minimum... ...too many ads...and it is not working when I clicked on boost.... The controls for the various parts of this app are crammed in with ads so as to make it confusing as to what to press. I became suspicious when the Clean function always came up with the same exact amount to clean. Plus, I did not notice ANY difference in the phone's performance after doing everything. I'm Uninstalling.. So I don't usually rate apps, when I do I'm either extremely satisfied or extremely unsatisfied. This app did clear up the junk however, it annoyed the hell out of me with its pop-up notifications every 5 minutes. Sure I could go turn off notifications and fix that and whatnot. But I would think you would want an app that wouldn't automatically on the first impression annoy the user. I recommend you remove the pop-ups. Let me know when you did that and I'll test the app back out. This app is not really a booster, but just a fake simulation. It only shows you what you want to see. I used 3 different phones, both cleaned 2.10GB junk at first use. Just a ploy in order to show you their ads. Also, after using the app, I checked by using Device Care. Storage, RAMs, still the same. Please don't be fooled by this fancy app.. This app sucks, ever since I got it my phone has dropped in performance to the point where it can't even open Google. I lag on my apps that are offline and it said it cleaned my phone but it didn't do anything, in fact it added junk files. This is probably the worst app that I've ever downloaded and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.. This app actually does absolutely nothing. I scanned memory and it says it's cleaning my memory but it's all for looks, does absolutely nothing. I'm fully aware things open back up automatically but this app is a total scam and should be removed from the play store. It blows my mind google hasn't done anything about these fake applications.. When I first installed this app years ago it worked great. After the last update it stopped working. I will \"clean\" my phone but always says \"0\" cache needed cleaning. However, under all my apps installed there is cache that needs cleaning. I now have to go through each individual app on my phone to clean them. Which takes a while to do. It is pointless for me to have this app on my phone when it does NOTHING. Just a waist of space and memory. If the issues get fixed then I will reinstall it.. ITS ALL BAD. I don't notice any difference in preformence. Ive clean cache and made the battery last longer, nothing has changed. It takes a lot of space and it drains your battery. there's a lot of ads, before you even do anything on the app, when you're done cleaning cache. ads when you're done doing anything, and when you click a button. Random pop-ups, I already got one saying how it needs cleaned when I was gonna give this a rating. make a app that actually works.. Useless and inaccurate. Doesn't clean the app caches. It just displays with its animation. It shows 137gb of storage while my phonehaving memory of 128gb. Its just a UI project.

I will email and not be that mean as I had been. Sry. It is the one! This is the best app if you finding someone to date. But the all thing reason was my cam is so dark? Why is it like that? My phone has no damage. I hope you can fix it soon. And i would rate this for 5 star\ud83d\ude0d", "neg_reviews": "\"Meet new people\"...but pay to talk to them on cam. Women reach out to talk to you with flirty messages, then encourage a private call for a large sum of money per minute. It's a cam girl site wrapped in a social site \"skin\". I feel it is a bit shady the way it's advertised. Also, most of the girls are from impoverished asian and south American locations. If you want a fake, expensive relationship with a stranger overseas...this app is for you. Or you could just go to a cam girl site.. very worst experience I hv complain 2times but issue not resolved. payment deduct but coin not credit in account. I I will never recommend this app to anyone. givi g you zero ratings. solve my problem. The app is free to download but the services are definitely not free. If you're looking for a money-grabbing fake profile people system then this app is for you. This is actually the first app that I've run across where you had to pay to chat or even calling anyone. This app is false advertising I'm uninstalling it and I will be looking for another app where I can actually associated with people without having to pay for it.. From my point of view there are pre recorded video on this app that will play when u talk to girls they will say hi and cut ur call,and sometime u will get to talk with girls which I think are paid for it by app to talk with mens for few minutes , observe carefully u will notice all this ,and app is great threat to ur security p. Stop asking to pay for sending messages when we have already purchased coins to make video calls and to match. It's ridiculous!!! We should be able to make a call without sending a message first and on top of that, to purchase more to send the message first before making the call. Don't forget... You all are not the only app that is providing this kind of services. So take heed!!!. Lame. Just another basic, swipe left or right app. That's all about you purchasing there pretend coin to use on calls. As if they don't make enough from the data usage. Monthly fees for packages are outrageously priced, the cost of everything is insane. When so many other basic apps, offer half of yours apps amenities free. Give away money for nothing but colorful distraction, this app is for you. Hoped for cool Tech, to keep the people connected during the pandemic. They're just taking advantag. App used to be good. Used to be able to skip users, and used to not have fake prerecorded profiles. They will tell you it's not fake but it is - use your volume button. If it's media volume, fake. Phone volume, real. They charge you gems for fake profiles. Never buying gems again with these new changes. App sucks so bad now. It's sad. Also, all the under 18 matches are fake people. Which seems... wrong.. Paid for 2500 coins , deducted my money and provided the payermax that u have added the coins. What a shameful one. It's been a week my fund got deducted. Simply waste of time and till now no coins got added.. There are children as YOUNG as 15 yo here. Rating is M17+. The average age is 20. I regrettably bought a subscription before realizing that I'm too old for the app and it is not appropriate or safe. There should be a day trial and verify ages. BS, I encountered a random girl who was 15, it said her name, 15. You don't even make them lie. AI my ass. That's an IF statement. Take care of business. I'll check in on the app in a week and report what I find. For each user If she <18 then delete user. False promises. They say if use the app for 30 consecutive days you get a reward. First it was going to be 8000 stars (which you can convert to coins) but about 3/4 away it change it to 400 coins. Then by the time I completed my 30 days I got nothing. Update after Omega replyed. They did not address my issue and only sent me a auto reply about how to verify my age if i was banned. No support for their lies. And if this is only a flaw then there is no support for that either.. Garbage, and fake accounts. The app says if you subscribe, the chat match would cost less coins (8 instead of 12), but it still took 12 coins for each chat. The people you start a chat with don't even say a word (especially girls). I think many of them are hired to start a chat and then leave just to deduct the coins. One way to spot a fake acount, go to recent matches. If you close the app and reopen it, you will see their pictures keep changing every time you close the app and reopen it.. This app is mainly a sex app but you will run into people who really do want to talk to you. I have met some awesome cool people that are actually just wanted to talk. One thing I wish the app allowed is changing your gender more than once. I accidentally clicked male in the begging process and have never been able to change it. People are very rude sometimes and will skip you if they think you're gay. Once again this app can be used to talk to cool people but the rest are going to be sexual.. BE AWARE OF THEFT! If I am able to give 0/5 I would. Worst chat app ever! SAVE YOUR $$$ AND DONT USE, STAY AWAY! I was ROBBED of about $30 CDN within seconds...when chat started the member requested a gift but I declined but it still took the coins out of my balance. When I reached out to customer service they simply said they can't refund and I have to talk to my bank or Google pay- POOR AND UNACCEPTABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! It was YOUR member while using YOUR APP this happened. CROOKS!!!. This app sucks. Unlike other apps that might have a free version and available paid upgrades, this one is entirely based on micro transactions, which only last for like 3 minutes anyways. Half the time when you DO meet someone, they ask for a gift of some kind anyways.. Pretty sure these are fake reviews. It's like an army of women are waiting there to tell me they love me and take my money. I was just looking for a chat, not seggs. It's just another chatroullete, in the global chat feature there are only guys beating their meat. Delete your source code.. Keep getting banned for no reason. Points stop at 5265 for the last few weeks. Can't see gifts I've received. Screen is usually dark. So many pen*s's and kids on here. Connection gets disconnected a lot. Translation doesn't always work. A lot of perverts asking for pus*y. Don't even say hi, they start with \"show _____\". What's the point of this app?. It's a free download but that's it. Everything else you have to pay for. if you want to be matched with people in your country you have to pay. To send a message you have to pay. This isn't a free random video app. I get marched with people on the other side of the planet and can't chat because I cant speak their language. Your location shouldnt have to be bought. Messaging I can understand. You can't video chat people in your specific country. Very poor communication ability in this app. Really slow and boring. I like using it when I'm bored to laugh at the people who think they can rap. Would be nice if you included options for more than just male/female as a gender choice. Sometimes it seems though that some of the people are just fake profiles because they skip way to fast. I love it it's just that you can't do a split screen with it and I was talking to some over for a very long time and once I did it split screen it disconnected me from the person I was talking to then when I went to my history I cannot find him. The basic features of this application are pay to use. These same basic features are free elsewhere. You can delete my review again but I will repost again. It's a shame to have people pay for services the other applications provide for free.

The only thing I don't like is the ads maybe in a later update the ads could lower?. I love that you can play many different leves and there are many different games. I have MeltDown, SubZero, And Geometry Dash World. If i were you guys, I would add more levels to All of the games. (mainly this one) Im not trying to rush you but the game is still super fun and addicting! My family even loves it. My sisters have it downloaded. Anyways, Thank you for making this game. It is a good time waster or a good game to play if you are bored. I gave it 5 stars because this game is awesome!~. This game is so entertaining, addictive, challenging, imaginative,great time killer and super cool features and its secret mystery is awesome! Best game I ever played... I will totally recommend this and not only this all geometry dash games! This game of yours is a success and a dream come true for us! Appreciate all the efforts you make. This game is so fun! Although it glitches and there's too many ads, it doesn't matter. I literally like the music and the online levels. This game is so cool, it's so fun, I downloaded this like in July or August. Best game ever! Although I passed all levels of geometry dash world songs. It was worth it! There are some bugs yes. Doesn't matter I mean like those creators are good like Lemons who made Enflux. These characters are kinda weird and some are good. I love this game so much :). This is a great game! I think all Geometry Dash games are the best. OK, I gave it a five star, because.. Hmmm. Let's say, it's creative, it's fun, but it takes a while to hop on to next level, (If your a noob, like me.) So it can take you to the top of Mount Rage and you might explode like a volcano after wards. Look, I'm not good at explaining why games are good, but hope it helps you. :). Nice Game. Better than copies. I kept this on playing and talking this to my friends, I am very, Very, VERY pleasured to you, RobTop is the best. Nice work but can you add something just like you can move your character by yourself, add a little new details and also some new icons and also, New levels? also badges, and also realistic like pictures? Addictive to play, Great awesome killer. Dab on these haters. \u2022dabs\u2022 Nice job!. this game is fun because on the full version l went crazy than I started to play geomerty dash a lot so since I like it I been playing some online levels I created my own levels and I also like this game because the graphics look cool!!!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d so that's what I just wanted to tell your creator of this game!!! and one more thing the one more thing is I love who ever I'm replying to but anyway by by!!! I love yaw\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d. This game is really fun, and I enjoy the fact that the levels are all different. Nothing generally repeats, and it gradually gets harder as you progress. It's cool because you can make an account for free to unlock more things, and there's nothing necessarily \"required\" to complete the game - just patience with the levels. You can answer riddles to open doors, but if you're not interested in that, there's still your average levels. Great game! :D. I love this app! I love especially the fact that you can use it offline. When I'm traveling, and I dont want to use data, or I have no service, I can play this. When I fail the levels tho, I can get pretty mad, but I just try again anyways. It's a great app and my brothers are glued to it! That's all they really play. It has a few ads, but not a lot. I highly recommend this app if your up for a challenge.. Ok, unlike Geometry Dash Lite this game is not laggy at all, plus there is so much more to do in this game! I'm in love with it! This game is super addicting and fun! I would highly recommend this to people who like doing things to the beat and like hard challenges! ( Disclaimer, you can't make your own levels, but I'm fine with that ). Very good game but wouldn't recommend if you get a lot seziers(?) There are many flashing lights in some of the levels. Anyways, this game has really good graphics alot of detail to somethings the controls are pretty hard to manage sometimes when I play it it won't let me jump even though I tapped the screen. Also, wouldn't recommend if you get angry alot. That's it I hope you enjoy the game :). It's a really good game. You can even make 2.2 levels on it! How to do that: Go to geometry dash full version upload a level make it copyable it's uploaded now so now press the button on the bottom left in my Levels view your level it's in the saved levels now. Go to accounts save your progress go to Geometry dash world load your progress go to saved levels copy your level press the edit button and you're done. Nice game :). Everything about this game is just extremely great. This game screams quality. From its awesome music, amazing background designs, everything is just so mesmerizing. It keeps me from staying on the app for longer hours because it is so addicting. I also love the hardness and challenges on each level, it's like it's almost the same as the levels on the lite version but quite more challenging\u2014which is really great because it makes the game more enjoyable to play.. This game is awsome it has most of the songs from geometry dash the full version but, it has so many songs. i would recommend this to anyone. Even though it is hard you just have to keep on trying. Like i couldn't pass the last level on dash lands but i kept on trying and i got it. I have trouble getting the crystals but im starting to get them. I hope you have just as much fun as i had and that's why I love and gave it five stars \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f. I hope you do to. For 2.11 or future update 2.2 (or so I was led to belie\u221ae) enthusiasts w/o the full \u221aersion and newbies alike! The easy levels can get people into the game and introduces them to a portion of the full version like online levels and such.. It was very good. Fun, challenging, and has a great story. But I have two problems. The first is that, after playing the same level for about forty-five seconds, the wave game mode gets really weird. I can't explain what happens. The second is that when you complete a daily, it takes quite a long time for it to load.. This a great game that I've played scince I was THREE. I love this game, but I wish there were skip tokens, or ads you could use to skip hard levels. That would really help in my opinion. I'm stuck on world 2 level 2. Other than that, great game. Keep it up! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd70\u2764. This is an amazing game, I just love how there is so many levels like the actual full version and more thanks to the online feature which allows you to play online levels created by other players, One bug needs to be fixed, The teleport glitch which teleports you randomly and destroys your character which is really annoying, But other than that, game is really amazing, Great game, really amazing job Robtop Crew, Especially Dex Arson, great job with the soundtracks!. It has amazing music and the obstacles are abstract and colourful, the beat matches every obstacle as well. It's an amazing game, and I recommend it to those who have fast fingers and like electronic music. I have no complaints about this game, so it earns a five-star rating from me. If at First You Don't Succeed, try, try again.. people complaining seem to be bad at the game. i experience no glitches nor lag. people please stop complaining because your bad. its mostly against my critic standards to rate a game before beating it however i doubt ill be able to beat it and i doubt ill be able to complete it (beat 100%) (complete 200%) however just cause im bad dosnt mean the game is.", "neg_reviews": "COMING SOON? I HAVE BEEN WAITING TWO MONTHS FOR THE NEW LEVELS TO COME IT SAYS THAT THERE \"COMING SOON\" BUT IT HAS BEEN FOREVER! PLEASE MAKE MORE LEVELS. Otherwise it's a really fun game with good graphics and good music. I'm just tired of waiting for more levels\ud83d\ude11. this game is trash! everytime i close the app then open it again my progress is gone and i have to start all over again! it doesn't even work in game and makes me close it out. congrats, u made my day worse then before. total uninstall. Delete this app now!everytime I tap in won't jump and it hits the spikes I hate this app!!!!. This game is pure trash. Even blind people wouldn't be able to play this, since this has nothing to do with rhythm. It changes phase way too fast and you get no time to concentrate and get adapted to the new behaviour. Practice Mode does help a little, but not much.. Got all the way to the end, and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow, and ended up having to restart all of the levels, fix this, it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games, just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted... Fix then 5 stars. It almost NEVER lets you jump at the right time. The game barely works DO NOT GET THIS GAME. I Hate this game i deleted the data of the game and logged in to the same account but it reseted all of my hard work and progress even though i saved it to my data space cloud.This really needs to be fixed because I had so many icons,ships,balls,waves,robots,and spiders and now its all gone please fix this i want my data back and all the levels i beat to again please fix this.. No. Just no. I loved the Geometry Dash games until you made this one. The levels are VERY short and EASY. TOO short and easy. I don't know why this is named Geometry Dash World, not Geometry Dash Toddlers Who Have Phones. It has become obvious that you're just in it for the money and you ruined a perfectly good, 5 star material game. What happened to you guys? The once addictive, interesting game has now become a milking cow for money. You have abandoned the gameplay (short levels, too easy) and focused on the unnecessary details (like the shops and 9000 types of currency). You have disappointed me. You receive 2 stars for the graphics.. This game is terrible. Do not download it do not wast your time on it. It sucks. The levels are way too long and way too hard. I'm mean hard games are fun but this game is way too hard to be any fun At all. The characters are all super ugly this game is no fun. I deleted it a day after I got it. I hate this, It keeps crashing for no reason. If it did not do that I would give it 5 star. And how come does the real version not do that? Is this a bug or something, Please fix this robtop if it's a bug.. this game in my opinion just crashed I now hate to the geometry dash series because level 4 and 5 just go from okay this is easy I can deal with this to what the heck is this stuff know when you hit level for you have to go from Jumping regular easy jumps to flying around in a spaceship who's driver is obviously drunken and then if you managed to make it past that you hit some level 7 material from lite and trust me I know I suck at this game but I think that's just too hard for a beginner.. This has literally been one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a gaming title. I have dumped hours into this game and for the love of God do not waste hours of you precious life for this game. You find yourself unable to quit and just continuously tap a screen in one spot for hours upon end, for what? Just to go onto another level you put fruitless hours that you could have spent on a game that shows progression, rewards, and something that means something. Plus the ad spam is striping.. To all 1 stars, so you see this, the game isn't the problem. The device is. I play on my phone, and although there is quite a bit of ads, it still functions fine. Speaking of ads, if there where no ads the game wouldn't be free. How else are they supposed to make money? My actual rating is 5 stars.. I hate the game. On the very first level I died bc it wouldn't jump. Fix that problem and then I will think abt downloading it again.. Gameplay is ok, however, sometimes when I tap the screen it's unresponsive and the as system is horrible. Sometimes when I open up the game or whenever I click the replay button it takes me to the play store to advertise a game. Terrible game, uninstalled after about an hour. This game is trash! I try to jump but I end up dieing. Every 5 or 1 death(s) it's an ad. The full game is much better but the demos, TRASH. The creator does not care about the comments. But we all agree that there is WAY TO MANY ADS. And it's so hard to beat. Dont waste your time playing this game guys. Its trash and must not be treated right.. I rate it a 2 cause the levels online levels aren't updating. Another reason cause the levels are too short. Another other reason why, is because the levels are too EASY. And another thing. THERE'S ONLY TWO WORLDS AND THEN THAT'S IT. I'm sad that there's a limited access to only featured, daily challedges, and basically saved levels. UHH I WISH THERE WAS MORE TO DO THAN PLAY FEATURED LEVELS OVER AND OVER. ok bi. New levels coming soon my butt :(. The game itself is entertaining enough. The ads, though, are obnoxious and impossible to close without opening the Google Play Store app. 1 star for contributing to making the internet a worse place; being part of the problem rather than the solution, etc.. I remember why I left such a negative review. There's a reason games like this don't catch on and gain massive attention a lot of the time. Punishing the slightest mistake with instantly failing and going all the way back to the beginning is not fun.

Once you played it you have the option to replay it but usually it will cost you real money to do so...the reoccurring theme is everything that you want in a golf game will require real money. This application has helped me every time I would switch my device to a new one I would always depend on this to keep my games safe and it's very helpful because I really don't have to work up back to the progress I have and I wouldn't make mistakes I can just begin off the progress I had and continue on from there. There's quite literally no downsides to this app. Some of the many good things that Google Play Games does for me include: facilitating the transfer of game saves between phones, allowing me one centralized place to access all my games without hunting all over the app drawer for them, the \"Accomplishments\" and related Play Level rating/profile thing is fun, and I enjoy the built-in games it features (Whirlybird, Solitaire, Cricket, etc) that can be played without data.. It's a good app, I just want to say that when you play online games back to back in the playlist menu there's an absurd amount of input lag. I \"played\" call of duty mobile through it. I put \"played\" quotations because aiming was impossible since every time you aimed it took 2 seconds to catch up and by then you had basically done a complete 180. 95% of the game mechanics are broken if you play it through Google Play. It's something that will happen when you stream games.. This game is adorable Good animations... hard but not impossible, and has SO many worlds to play, beat, and unlock! I am updating it to the latest update right now, and I am excited for the update. \ud83d\udc31 If someone is looking for like a cute parkour game that isn't too hard but isn't too easy, this is a good game for them and they should definetely install it. So basically this game is a geat game, and I love all the details put into each world to make each world different. Keep up the good work!\u2665. i use this and its great.... it basically can help as can save files for me it connects the the games that I play with the people who I play with and it makes it so that my gaming experience through my phone is connected as it would be through another console and an online platform only issues I've ever had with this is that sometimes I play a game and don't sign into it so it does not keep my filed that is the most problem I never had it is all in all a great app I 100% recommend it it frees me.. It is a great app! People keep having problems with the app because they have a older device. Older devices may have huge issues with this app because they aren't updated anymore. The app works great for me and allows me to transfer all data perfectly on my Motorola G Fast. Don't try and fix anything. This is why people should list they're devices. This is the experience I want to have.. i love this app, it has so many features like you can see how good your friends are in video games and you can unlock achievements. also some apps allow you to connect your google play account to back up your data which is awesome and so easy to do! i love this app definitely one of the best gaming apps I've ever seen. This game is a long term strategy game. If you download it, it will take 6 months to be really competitive and every age and league offers stronger and more able real world opponents. The guild system is cool with World Wars. If you're not patient, this is not the game for you. It's part Civilzation part Risk but neither at the same time. I've enjoyed it for about 2+ years and am currently in the Industrial Age. It'll be awhile before I move up again.. Have enjoyed it for the most part. If I had one complaint it would be that its a bit boring so I never check into most of what mt it offers. Most of the games I play have a lot of the same things already with them . Like sharing with friends and/or competing with them. Leaderboaed stuff doesn't suit me as I AM NOT A WINNER! Lol! No need to see how far behind I always am!! \ud83d\ude01.

I don't mind spending my money now, I don't feel guilty. I get my points I'm a Gold membership and I earn a little extra money back when I need it!! It helps when I need that 2 or 3 dollars I don't have I use my points. It's just great! THANK YOU!!!!!. I don't understand why Google needs so many different apps that all end up linking to one app anyhow?! But I didn't go to school for this lol so what I do understand of it it works great any games having issues should open right on up with this app. The controls are the same as if you are just in play store. It dose exactly what it is excepted to do I think, lol , I also don't know exactly how it should work in all ways either but my understanding of it , it works great. Thanks Google \ud83d\ude0a. Fixed again!! Had been broken for 1-2 weeks now. Every time I launched a game, I was immediately warned through a notification that there is a problem. Then I click on it, to see that it has somehow been Disabled. Once enabled, it lasts until the next time I launch a game, then same thing all over again.... Awesomegreat games, and earn achievements and high scores.

My issue with Google Play is that I can't add funds to my account for some reason. For years now, or longer, I cannot load funds through the app or by purchasing a Google Play GC. I have 2 gift cards, valued at $80 total, that will not transfer to my acct. I can't get refunds so it's just wasted money. Customer serv is a joke, NO HELP AT ALL. Fix that and I would give 5 stars. Having an issue where it just doesn't run on my phone, just keep on loading. I tried everything from changing to other ISPs, updating to newest version, forced stop, reinstalling, and even clear data. It doesn't let me log in my Google account on any game I use Google account to play. If you really need an app to let me use my Google account to play games, please make it as stable and simple as you can. Please fix it soon, it's been like this for 2 days.. The entirety of google play needs to be revamped. False star ratings as far as the eye can see. You see 4.4 stars until you open the reviews and almost all the games reviewers are rating 1 star. Games are insanely overloaded with micro transactions and at least twice as many ads. I spend more time trying to find a good game than I do actually downloading or even playing them. The developers need to be held to a higher standard. Ads have gotten longer and more intrusive.. It's great if you want to play your game on multiple devices. The con, it doesn't automatically sign in to your saved game when you log in. I have to manually do it after the game loads, then the game has to reload, and guess what It doesn't work the second time or the third. 15 minutes later I'm in. I spend about $300 a month on this app, I shouldn't have to deal with this.. Doesn't work correctly on my device. It fails to connect when trying to login to some games. There's just a white box and an endless spinning circle. Tried all the known \"fixes\" but nothing works. If i check the account it says the game is connected but it refuses to let me login. Sometimes I even get the notification bubble with my name that usually pops up when you connect but it's still not registering in the app/game that I am connected.. Usually this app is fine, but I've had the same issue as someone else who wrote a review yesterday, that I try to log into Star Wars Heroes and it says it's been 24 hours or another device has logged in, I was playin it late last night/early morning and something has gone wrong in them 8-10 hours, would love this to be resolved please.. it works sometimes, other times it doesn't. i really could live without it, and honestly prefer TO live without it. now, i'm not allowed to play any games without this app, which is quite frustrating, especially considering that i have a device that can't handle many apps running in the background, as well as little storage & memory.. it works sometimes, other times it doesn't. i really could live without it, and honestly prefer TO live without it. now, i'm not allowed to play any games without this app, which is quite frustrating, especially considering that i have a device that can't handle many apps running in the background, as well as little storage & memory.. Wondering what the purpose of this app is... I used to check in, soley to view XP level and achievements. But third party sites seem to do a much faster job of bringing that information up -- and in a meaningful way (i.e.: player stat comparisons, overall and per game leaderboards, etc.). And what is up with all of the cookie-cutter reviews that are supposedly rated most useful: \"Very good service\", and the like?. I play the games every now and then out of pure boredom but for the past... I do believe it's been five months, and countless updates, after a game or two the app freezes and shuts down my phone. Sadly can't deactivate it once and for all 'cause other games need to connect to it, and some even work slower without it, somehow. Drains the battery and is a waste of phone space.. I hate that i have to install this app in order to play the games I have already downloaded in the play store. Like, I'm not a hardcore mobile player and I dont really care about ranking or achievements. Why need this app when you already have the play store? Not only that it seems irrelevant, but it also takes up additional space in my phone. i like it. i really do! i just dont see the point in it unless this is going to become facebook or the tinder of amazon. i just think that, if your going to need an app for your games, why not just have the games inside it? why download on playstore, then on google play, when that could just be it? 2 star for now!. this new update CAN HACK ACCOUNTS. After reading some comments, I am sure that I'm not the one experienced this . But, it wasn't Just MOBILE LEGEND. But all of the games can't be switched account. Once you've Open an account, and try to open another. You have to be a scientist first to know whats going on and why you can't change account. And because of this , I keep monitoring my phone if ever there will be A 'GHOST' account that will appear . This strategy can be used for HACKING?!. I have it for years and it's great, now I got a new phone, and it keeps logging in and out every 2 minutes, I did everything I was told by customer support I even factory reset my phone and nothing... I still give thumbs up to support team for fast and diligent assistance. But nothing worked, app still broken for me.. I have been having problems with Google Play Games on my old phone for months, back when it was my main phone. I have sent multiple reports and nothing has been done. I am very disappointed in this service. Luckily it works on my new phone, but I can't transfer game saves to my new phone because Google Play Games won't work on the phone with my progress.. I don't know what has gone wrong with this app, but it went from running more or less normally, to constantly popping up messages about it stopping. It can happen while using other apps, even ones that dont require net access, and while using YouTube or browsing. It's been going on for days. It's become a serious problem that needs a fix.. Google play seems to be GREAT!! Its probably me, (?), moreoverly my dinosaur, little phone that cannot download an app with \"too much content\".... So chrome decides to take matters into its own, decisive hands and delete some of that content, right? App still doesnt download. (Im convinced its a little game it likes to play on me...) Im left with limitations. Not tolerable in my world. Going shopping for new phone.When i return my little phone is going to learn a new definition for \"limitations\". Service keeps stopping with no explaination and locking up my phone. Nothing I've tried has fixed it. EDIT: Cleared cache now I'm waiting to see if it continues to give me errors. I've never had a problem with it until now and I hope it's going to start working again for me. EDIT: It keeps saying to update it but I can't find an update anywhere since it's fully up to date. I've even tried deleting and reinstalling but I still continue getting the error even when the app is not installed.. Usually give 5 stars however not able to sign in to my pinball apps that spent lot of money on. Updated app, checked all settings but keeps looping me back. It says \" you need to sign in to access global leaderboards & achievements\" so I click sign in & it says \"please wait\" then stops, same result every time. It's frustrating Google peeps cos now ive lost progress. Mandatory totalitarian style Google Play fail means I'm out of pocket & out of the competitions. Out of order, needs sorting ASAP!. it was a great and helpful app at first that held all my previous gaming experiences if i ever want to redownload them, which was awesome, but lately, there's this error that keeps displaying the opening loading screen over and over again. I tried clearing the cache already but it doesn't work. I got desperate enough to uninstall and reinstall it too but that didnt work. i can wait for over an hour and it still wont load.

Hope they find a source of revenue but dont look forward to when the subscription and poor free service starts. Reminds me of Skype, back before they got full of themselves. I suppose you cant leave well enough alone? Thanks for the use I've gotten, to date! Good Job! Edit after 1 year: Great App and a bargain. Hope the prices don't increase too fast without a \"tiered\" option. Again, Thank You.. I have also been using it since March 2020 every day there hasn't been a problem since,until the August and September updates came. Now, it's barely seconds before the whole meeting is inaudible... the video and audio lag, though if I connect through my laptop, it works fine. It had been 5 stars before. Could the developers check what's going wrong? By dialling in first, even if the call doesn't go through, then I go back and join through the call over the Internet, it works fine. Now it's fine.. This is an excellent app and makes the world smaller. If you look at any of the negative reviews you will normally find that it is their hardware or the quality of their internet connection that is the problem. Despite working with so many different devices and internet providers etc, ZOOM usually works anyway. The controls are pretty intuitive. A great app. Update: Continue to grow their capabilities and is a very valuable connection during the pandemic.. Thanks for fixing the audio issues. This apps update is getting better. It has got better screensharing quality. Good background effects and good quality video. Sometimes I cannot see the video of others. And sometimes when I on mine it comes like a grayscale kind of view and the other participants can't see my video. Not so sure it is my network problem. Overall it is a very good app for meetings with different kind of features.. This is the best app ever! It has so many nice features. The best audio-visual quality and other features of screen sharing, chat and all. I suggest everyone to download this app.. Of all the video conferencing apps I've had to use this past year, Zoom is the best. Others have been glitchy, complicated, or of poor quality. Zoom is user friendly, can be used across all platforms, and scales easily for all group sizes. Plus, it's incredibly intuitive for non tech savvy users. It beats Microsoft teams' clunky, unintuitive user interface and poor transmission quality hands down. Great app all around!. In my opinion, Zoom is the best video conferencing. This app only gives a period of 40 minutes when not upgraded, yet this a very well-developed video conferencing app. This app makes meetings more secure than any other app makes. It is very easy and reliable to use both in PCs and Mobile devices. We can even chat in between the meetings even privately. After I updated this app in my laptop, it had provided me background images and filters. There is just one problem-I can't apply a background.. ZOOM has been a blessing to me. I got introduced to this App only in 2020, during the pandemic. I have been using this App since then. Very effective to communicate between people. And I really love this App over other similar Apps available in the net.. Zoom is a blessing, its not perfect, nothing in this world is perfect, God bless the person or persons who invented this app, keep up the good work, there are some kinks that needs to be straightened out, sometimes voice or picture quality could be better. Picture and voice quality much improved, again, thanks for your service. Voice and picture quality continue to Improve, Thanks great improvement, continue the great work, God bless you all. ZOOM is great! Especially now that COVID 19 is worldwide, I am over 65 and have pre-existing conditions, I need to stay at home as much as possible, and ZOOM even lets me keep most of my Doctors appointments while not putting myself at risk! It works just as well on my cellphone. Visual is quite good in terms of clarity. Even colors are wonderfully vivid. The sound quality could not be any better. It's FREE! I just wish there was a place to list my most frequently used Meeting ID numbers.. Zoom is an amazing app. It makes for smooth and easy virtual meetings: I highly recommend zoom as the first choice app for virtual meetings. Is it possible to get an option that slows down the speed of recordings? As of the time I posted this, options to speed up the recordings, were the only available options; none to slow down the recording. I think it'd be an excellent addition.. This is the best app for online classes and meetings with family and friends. I love its features. It is very easy to use. There are some small features that make it the best of all other platforms. Like while the teacher is teaching, you can swipe a little bit to pause the frame. This helps if the teacher is about to erase anything from the board. I wish that it could support 2 meetings at a time on one device \ud83d\ude01. Its security has improved a lot and you don't have to worry about zoom bombing.. Always works. Audio and video sometimes stutters. I think the only thing that could be improved is some kind of background noise or feedback filter. This could be resolved by everyone muting when not speaking but that doesn't lend to a dynamic natural conversation. Overall, this app has worked well for group meetings. But there's always room for improvement with technology. The more it can be made to feel like we're in-person the better. The image/document share works good too.. This app is much more than a fun little \"new shiny\" for me. It has enabled me to excape total isolation & solitude & begin exploring virtual support groups, making new friends I, otherwise, would have never met. Plus, since I can visually interact w/ others, rather than talk or text only, it's the next best thing short of an actual visit. I am so thankful for this free version that doesn't restrict one-on-one chats. A lifesaver.. Still EXCELLENT- over 15 months now. This is fantastic! I can easily and, without a load of difficult passwords etc, join my workout group. I like having the option to myself not be on video. Audio is clear and it is really a great platform. I will be more inclined to access programs using thos platform going forward. I live remotely, so Zoom has opened up a whole world of great exciting classes I can access. Thank you!. Pleasantly surprised at this app. I just started a new job and my internet company had some issue and so I had no internet. My 1st day of mandatory training and no internet. I almost lost my job. Thankfully I was able to use zoom on my phone. No issues at all with connecting and staying connected. It didn't give me any trouble even with 2 bars of cell signal.. Good app for meetings. In this pandemic virtual meeting takes place and zoom is the number one app for Meetings. It is very useful for online classes, meetings etc. Not only that, it has a very Good security. It has a waiting room as well which I think is very useful. It also has an option for Screen sharing. But with all of that good features, the time is limited to 40 minutes if more than 3 people. So, Zoom please with your next update please make the time unlimited. but a very Good app. This app is great since the last update. They fixed a lot of things, but I still can't choose a background. I'm not worrying, since I know this is an issue with my computer, but would like a feature added where it can tell the user if their computer is compatible with that function. Overall, this is a great app, maybe even greater than Skype! I do worry when a vaccine will be invented for COVID-19, as Zoom will probably go out of business. If they don't, may they live on forever!. Useless. No-one can hear me , I checked settings and am pressing the red unmute microphone button- NOTHING! Someone said House Party is better..... Above was my first review. Since then I've learned that you have to adjust settings on your device. After that I found Zoom easy to use, good sound quality and I use it a lot. In fact, wouldn't be without it!!!. Excellent, very clear, very effective. So convenient. Accomodates enough people. Impacts a large group of people. Availabilty of information shared. Pictures and audio very clear. Can reach a large no of places and groups at the same time. The features are also very good (such as the recording, reactions, typing directly to a specific peraon and so on). Being able to share power points and other related materials is also very good. Pictures can be takem which makes it so unique.", "neg_reviews": "[Updated] Before it was working well even if I had to restart my phone, but now that is not helping either. I'm not giving a 1 star because I only use it for one class, and it has two good features like private chat option and easy accessible whiteboard. To be honest, Google meet is far better, even though it don't have the features I mentioned for Zoom. I will uninstall this stupid app the moment I'll be able to do so.. The app works well and without any interruptions. But I'm still unable to use this app with Bluetooth eatphones. This is very serious since new mobile phone are getting rid of the headphone jack and in that case Bluetooth is a must. Whenever I join a meeting with Bluetooth earphones,it works well for 2 minutes and then it starts lagging. Please resolve this issue before it's too late..

This is very serious since new mobile phone are getting rid of the headphone jack and in that case Bluetooth is a must. Whenever I join a meeting with Bluetooth earphones,it works well for 2 minutes and then it starts lagging. Please resolve this issue before it's too late.. My rating may change in the future. Zoom worked just fine until about a week ago, when it stopped recognizing the microphone on my tablet. Even after uninstalling and reinstalling, testing and changing settings, it still did not recognize the microphone. I can now no longer use this app. (The visuals are ok, I can hear \"them\" but \"they\" can't hear me.). It's much more convenient, quick & easy to click the link on my device and then use smart share on the TV. There are more than 4 of us it messes with the app if we all have to get on individually, but the app doesn't allow the sound to transfer to the TV! Can't hear a dang thing going on but we can watch it just fine. We've tried different options to work with the sound, the app won't allow.. This app has helped me throughout the pandemic attending my school and coaching but the bugs, glitches are HELLA IRRITATING!!! like , i was not able to join few class and it used to show \"connecting\" the whole time, and recently, even if i used to unmute and say something, no one was able to hear my voice and because of this problem i was irritated as HELLL as i was not able to answer a lotttt of questions from the teacher even if i knew!!!! I hope zoom takes this seriously and fixes all this !!. It was working fine for me but after updating to the latest version, the audio has stopped functioning properly. I can't hear anything during the meeting and the voices of other people keeps breaking . Not a single word is properly audible! And i am unable to attend my classes on my phone. I know that this isn't the fault of the phone because the unupdated version on another device is working properly. I hope this technical glitch is resolved soon!!. This app gives a lot of video lag and dropped audio, so I tried using the app for video and dial-in for audio, to reduce bandwidth. That worked somewhat okay, but here's the problem. When you call in, you have to enter a really long meeting number and a passcode, and Zoom gives you only 10 or 15 seconds to enter the very long meeting number. If you're unable to quickly enter the meeting number, Zoom kicks you off the call. Come on! Please give us more time to enter the info.. I'm a student and I'm using this app from the past 4 months and it has given me a lot of trouble. When I'm in class suddenly it gets disconnected or my teacher won't be able to hear my audio. Even if my internet connection is perfect I always get problems like these. I won't be able to attend classes properly because of these problems, Sometimes if it gets disconnected and when i try to re login it just shows \"preparing meeting\" and thats it. Nothing else happens. Please solve these problems.. I used to like zoom a lot. But since I have updated the latest version I'm having a lot of problem of audio. I couldn't hear the others much clearly and the same happens with my friends. If this problem is not resolved quickly I wouldn't use this app anymore. I am rating it two star due it's facilities, otherwise I would have rated it one star or less.The audio problem should be resolved as soon as possible.. It's practically unusable after the most recent update. I've been using the app for over four and a half months, and have only started getting errors (particularly a lot of crackly, cutting-out audio) after the most recent update. I considered leaving two stars, but due to the fact that it is currently completely unusable, I couldn't in good conscience leave more than one star. It's truly a shame to see an app with so much potential in this app's current state.. Great app but it also having huge problem they all are below-: 1. Phone get very much high temperature while using. 2. It also take a lot of data. 3. Difficulties to login (if you take phone number for login it will be very easy for every type of person) 4. Takes a lot of battery. These are some point which I would like to request to you please solve it out as much as you can... Thank you.

Sometimes if it gets disconnected and when i try to re login it just shows \"preparing meeting\" and thats it. Nothing else happens. Please solve these problems.. The 9/1/2020 update still has audio and video issues. The picture freezes, and impacts audio quality. People complain about not being able to hear me, or if they can my sounding crackly. I'm disappointed, several updates have been made since March and the audio has not been corrected. Audio, video worked well prior to the last few updates. Once it starts working as it did in March I will raise my rating.. Using Zoom is wearisome. The data requirement is unnecessarily high. It disconnects too frequently. Also, it doesn't save the meeting IDs of recurrent meetings. You have to manually type them each time. I hope your developers aren't sleeping. Even at this time, one is still unable to share video with sound on Android phone. You guys are cashing out during this pandemic. So, I wonder why it's difficult for you to make all necessary upgrades as at when due with these several negative feedbacks. I have been using the app for more than 6 months and never had any issues till now. But since 4-5 days, after I updated the app, the problem started. Because of the new update, zoom is behaving abnormally. The audio is cracking up, the video is also disturbing frequently, many other problems are also occuring. Please look into this matter asap because it is getting very difficult to take online classes. All the teachers along with the students are facing this issue.. Since several of my friends and I have updated the software in these 2 days, ALL of us found that there have been always weird noises coming out from the devices for all the participants! We have no idea why but that makes all participants hard to clearly speak to and hear from the others. The previous verion just worked totally fine. We are all using the paid subscription. If this problem persists, we ll have no choice but to explore another platform. Change for better for ourselves!!. A lot of issues, sometimes, the network issue, or audio or video issue. All these problems are there despite my network connection is strong enough. And doesn't matter much either you update this app or not, it stays the same, and most of the times, it shows wrong meeting ID where I connect almost daily. Not at all satisfied with the service of this application. Adding on, majority of the times, 'server not found' or 'server busy' appears. Hope zoom resolves these problems soon.. The worst app for doing meetings and online classes. Even after updating the zoom every time a new update came, the app crashes. Sometimes it becomes so frustrating, like I'm talking to the teachers and in the middle of the conversation it got disconnected and a displayed that there is an error, and check your network....even though I had a proper internet connection. Not only me, but many of my classmates are also facing the same problem recently.. Audio at times disappears or is garbled. Video not always clear without breaking up. Can only see 4 people at a time. I have very high speed internet service that is consistently strong. Not a problem with streaming. The zoom app has glitches, works sometimes and other times does not. Too much zoom traffic corrupts the app. Looking to switch to another service that consistently works and is reliable.

As you go down here in the review section, You'll notice people talking about a 2$ offer in game that gave 140 mega boxes instead of 1. The development team gave the very reason for this to occur. They said that the program which was supposed to check the upload of these in game offers had failed. They also said that they were taking care of the program and fixing it to make sure this does not happen again.Finally, I wanted to say that people do make mistakes , forgive them.. Ive played a lot of mobile games. This is hand down the best one of all time. Its a twin stick masterpiece with lovely controls, crisp graphics, and a fair progression system. The devs listen to the community and continue to put out quality content by the MONTH! (Not during their summer break, but they deserve it!) 10/10 have played consistently since 2018 and will continue to. Its been 4 years now. Cant believe Im typing that, but everything i said is still true.. Honestly, its just very fun, all the characters are diverse and well balanced...well almost all. But i think this game deserves 5 stars cuz honestly, its fun and engaging, its multiplayer, its fast paced and its committee and content creators are supported by supercell. Overall I love this game and encourage you to try, i promise you won't regret it.. Best Game I have ever played. This game is Simple enough for new players to understand but also Complex enough for tryhards to enjoy the game! With over 50+ different Characters, and with different playstyle, to choose from and around 40+ different build combinations for each character, to enhance your playstyle! Overall, this is a great game if you are the type of person who wants to have fun or if you just want to play something competitive.. OMG I play this all the time when I'm bored and I already want more new brawlers. I wish that you can request new brawlers. In my opinion, I think that the game still has some problems, the game can make getting a new brawler from a mega box higher than having to waste so many gems on buying box after box. I wish it was all easy to get brawlers. But now that it is season 9, it was super easy for me to get a whole bunch of strong brawlers. But now I think it is kinda hard to beg for a new brawler. Hii supercell, first of all I really love this game. There are so many kind of different modes, variety of brawlers, events and much more. Overall the game is good, but I think you can add that volleyball game mode permanently, as now I'm getting a bit bored from this. Anyways that's all my review. Thank you.. OMG I play this all the time when I'm bored and I already want more new brawlers. I wish that you can request new brawlers. In my opinion, I think that the game still has some problems, the game can make getting a new brawler from a mega box higher than having to waste so many gems on buying box after box. I wish it was all easy to get brawlers. But now that it is season 9, it was super easy for me to get a whole bunch of strong brawlers. But now I think it is kinda hard to beg for a new brawler. Really fun and well made game. The devs listen to feedback, and it is f2p. If you don't want to spend money, you can play and progress easily. It takes skill. It can be frustrating if you lose a few games in a row, but you can practice and get better. They consistently give out free rewards that help progression without removing the difficulty, constantly adding interesting content that is simple but changes the game. There are 14 modes to play in (not counting variations or maps.) I recommend!. I have been playing for 2 years now, and I'm EXTREMELY picky with mobile games. Anyways, i really love this game it can get a little boring after a while; since there are 4 events( i think only 4) that keep repeating but every once in a while you get a temporary or permanent game mode (depending on how many people like the game mode) and new brawlers! -a BIG fan.. I've been playing this game for several years now and I must say, this is one the best mobile games I have ever played! If someone ever tells you mobile games aren't real games, show them Brawl Stars. The gameplay is easy to play, there are plenty of characters to choose and upgrade, multiple game modes and special events. Plus the developers are always interacting and they always update and listen to the players. If u want a PvP action game with lore, I highly recommend this game.. Many mobile games have come and gone on my phone, but I keep coming back to this one. A fair and fun game that can be as casual or hardcore as you want it to be. Quick matches with the fastest matchmaking I've ever seen in a game, ever. This game values your time, which is more than I can say for 99% of the Play Store. Seriously, great work to the developers and the continual updates every season.. This game has to be the best f2p game from supercell. The amount of rewards you get from the brawl pass is insane! Every season the free pass gives you 90 free gems, and the paid pass only requires 169 gems (Nice) meaning you can buy the brawl pass every two seasons. And the rewards are 13 times more than 169 gems. Honestly, I have to say that the brawl stars developers really cares about their players and they give free rewards every once in a while. Thank you brawl stars developers \ud83d\ude0a. I think this game is fun, competitive, and every player can enjoy the game with or without spending any money. For free player like me, I only use gems to buy brawl pass (yes, we will have enough gem every 2 season to buy it) and use star points to buy boxes from the shop once it is available. With this strategy, we can get almost all brawlers in the game. Good job supercell... Thank you for this great game.. Amazing game! as all games should be :P this is the best game from supercell as other supercell games we have to make a base and stuff, only this game offers fighting style gameplay! easy controls, there is no confusing thing about this game, playable on a stable internet connection (my guess minimum 1mbspeed). easy to learn, challenging to master!. It's a most incredible game I've ever seen, actually this is my favourite game. You can add more things if u want too, anyways let's back in. You can collect gems basketball \ud83c\udfc0 map and so many maps and things to do. You can choose ur brawler. And do fun! My favourite map is knockout but it is limited time. But they comes again and again and new maps also come! I love this game updates. If anyone is reading this comment I said... Try thiss game otherwise I will eat ur cooookkeee \ud83c\udf6a. This game is so fun! I play it everyday and never get bored. It has many players and you can even create a team! You can play whenever you want, best thing, YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE HEARTS IF YOU LOSE A GAME!! You just play! You can upgrade and change your characters! I spend hours on end just playing, I don't get how nobody in my house plays this amazing game! My FAVORITE character is Nita and her bear. This is the best, I hope many people find this game interesting and boredom breaking like I do!. Hi! This is absolutely my favorite game! I've been playing since 2020 Brawlidays! Not gonna lie, I'm kinda disappointed with the new update since I'm F2P and \"gears\" made maxing out a little more complicated. Aside that, the game is really good! I enjoy completing my quests. This game do deserves more players. It's super fun! I would totally recommend this if you're finding something to cure your boredom. For new players, pushing takes time, but I'm sure that you'll become better in the game.. Really amazing out of the box game . I was sick of building and combat(gun) games. This is really good for you if you also want to switch a game. Actually it is not a side option , it is a main optional. This game is easy to play(but tactical) you should really try this game.. A great game. Lots of things to do different maps and different events that change over time. Really good way to pass some time. Not pay to win and to unlock better stuff all you have to do is play. Each brawler (the characters in the game) feel different and take skills to learn them all. There are 52 current brawlers to unlock. Fun, fast, and competitive pvp. This game also doesn't drain your battery. No im not a bot i really do enjoy this game I highly recommend trying it out.\ud83d\udc4d. The 1 star reviews are mostly about a glitched shop offer that cost two dollars instead of its actual value, a few hundred dollars. Not many people got it, but for some reason it made a lot of people really mad at the devs even though they quickly fixed it. The game is really good, and I don't want it to be ruined because the team made one mistake.", "neg_reviews": "Me and my friends loved this game a lot a year ago. Until gears appeared. Gears are the worst cause it gives a way bigger advantage to people and most of them get it by gemming. Everytime I go into a match, I see a level 11 guy coming and destroying everyone. It is soo annoying. Pls brawl stars, remove the gears. The game is turning into p2w and 80% of the players don't like it. Pls consider removing the gears. This is a good time waster. It's very fun, but a lot of the things you need to progress in the game you need to pay for. Edit: Everything froze on the screen when I updated the app. When I opened it again, the screen had shrunk into the top left corner. The touch calibration was also off. When I exited the app, my phone was glitchy and everything on my home screen was shrunken as well. My phone fixes itself when I restart it, but breaks whenever I try to go back into the app. Please fix this.. Used to be fun, until they started to make brawl stars pay to win. Now, after I get about to rank 5-10 with a character, it becomes unplayable because I keep getting destroyed by kids who are EXTREMELY PAY TO WIN. So, you need to fix your matchmaking, but ALSO fix how a simple LEGENDARY character has a 0.0052% chance of getting, and how you can buy them for 699 gems if you get a \"special offer\" (30$) Just one more thing; make the chances of getting Legendary and other characters POSSIBLE to get!. The controls shoud be more customizable according to the players desire for optimum comfort. The issues with the current controls is that there is no \"locked position\" for the movement control.. The game is really awesome. And, it's one of those rare cases where you don't have to spend real money to be good. It all depends on your skills. Edit 1 : Lately there has been a lot of glitches in this game. I am unable to change my gadgets and star powers in power league. Edit 2 : Now, even the lag of this game has become intolerable. Even though my wifi speed is quite high, the game is now lagging all the time which results in a lot of losses.. Ive been playing this game for 2 years so take it from me: this game really IS BS. Can't get past rank 22/35 with most brawlers if you're solo. The game's servers are garbage, I disconnect every game yet, my internet speed is 200mbps. If you move your phone even a slight bit, you disconnect. I won 10 games in a row at rank 24 with Bibi, getting MVP each time, that's 80 trophies- then lost 15. All trophies gone. This game has seriously messed with my mental state. This game can make you suicidal.. This app recently faced a minor bug in which you could buy 130 mega boxes for 2$. I mean this is unfair to all other players who been playing since years. As.. you could create account and spend 2$ and now you can compete others >2 year old account. Why wouldn't you take back those rewards and leave 2$ worth with players. This really hurt me, I been playing this game from beta but now supercell is doing soo many things \"to improve this game\" but you ruined it.. Ah yes the game is awesome\ud83d\udc4d. But getting legendary is hard, because if you get one, the chance will decrease by 0.05 percent, because it's hard to increase the chance. But it's now easier with the new brawl pass system. Since there's now a lot of mega boxes. And Power league kinda sucks. The meta isnt just that good. They ruined the whole game, for $ 2.50 you could buy 149 megaboxes, it's amazingly bad from your side as developers, people playing since 2018 have the same pumping as the newcomers who bought this promotion. I think ,you should give everyone who didn't buy this promotion 149 megaboxes, or take everything that the people who bought it received, as you do, when returning the purchase.. This is an ok game I will say, okay gameplay, good graphics, everything about is okay, I would sort of recommend. A few problems I have is like lagging to death, this is very unfair when losing is out of your control so maybe you lose less trophies if you lag or something? That would be good. This game is very very toxic and unfun, people spin and sad emote and are very toxic. I wish teaming and spinning would result in punish. Overall this game is okay if it didn't have such a toxic community.. They released a glitched offer for 5 minutes to create buzz as part of the promotion..only some people got the chance to buy it and they are way ahead of others in progression..it really affected other players who are playing the game and got same progression for 2 years..but that glitched offer helped some new players to reach ahead of progression..and brawl stars is not doing anything to compensate the players who did not buy that offer by bringing back the offer. The most unbalanced game I've ever played. It was much better earlier, the more additional stuff they're adding to game is just making it more trash. The people using money on game are getting their brawlers maxed faster than others. And there's no point of playing against them because they'll be exceptionally overpowered. It's sad to see my favorite game turning into pay-to-win game.. I like this game don't get me wrong, but the Gears update was unnecessary and nerfed Free To Play player progression quite a bit. I still find the game fun it's just, the game has become more like other mobile games now regarding monetization. I have nothing against monetizing the game but the change to make some brawlers harder to get is just very Free To Play player unfriendly.. It starts off as a fun, balanced game that quickly turns into frustrating pay-to-win nuisance. Gadgets were pushing it and gears are awful.. I've been playing this game before it went global and it is the only game I have kept for longer than a year. It is fun, you can play with friends, the games don't take too long, and the devs are always trying to improve it and change things up! However, recently (in the past half a year), the matching system have become useless where level 2s are constantly matched with level 8+. How can the game be played fairly if a level 8 knocks out your level 2 instantly? Please fix this!. Was originally a unique game that was really easy to pick up and fun from the start. I started playing a month before the game went global and have spent over 400 hours playing this game, it is one of the best mobile team based pvp games out there. Sadly, several new features make the game more challenging and complex for new players and less fun for old players. I am referring to gears and gadgets. The gadgets are a good change that balanced characters but gears make the game not fun anymore.. I used to give this game 5 stars, but after an extremely abusive past few months with community service, I've realized that the only good part of the game is the gameplay. The 140 mega box offer, the rejection of refunding silver/gold skins, the other broken offers from not too long ago, power levels 10 and 11, and the sheer rejection has been nothing but hell and I'm so glad I have other things in my life, because this is truly an awful thing to do to a community that used to love you.... matchmaking is a hot disaster. it should also be based on power levels, cause its not fair fighting power 10 while you're just a power 3. plus teaming in showdown. the rewards you get when you're a f2p is trash. It isn't fair, we get 30 coins in a tier, only. 30. coins. i hope you prioritize your updates, not only for adding stuff to the game but BY FIXING THE GAME ITSELF (especially your controls). amber should never have existed. she connects her shot, you can't evade it, you just die. fix it.. I've been playing Brawl Stars since launch and have been liking it a lot, even spending far more than \u20ac100 on it, which is a lot considering my situation. But they make too many mistakes, like putting out an offer which gives you a year's worth of progress for \u20ac2, meaning I spent more than \u20ac100 to get less than the people who spent those \u20ac2. The creators did nothing about it, no compensation or anything and only gave a lack-luster Twitter apology. That is the reason I no longer support this.. Stupid game! Trash!! Fix the damn auto aim. I'm next to an opponent and i keep aiming in the opposite direction. Stupid developers!! A zero stars", "pos": "Players rave about Brawl Stars' **fast-paced, fun, and engaging gameplay**, praising its **easy controls** and **crisp graphics**.

This has become rather inconvenient due to the amount of videos that show up as unavailable due to being deleted by the original poster. It this a glitch that will be fixed or something set? As soon as I remove the video it shoots me up to the top even when I'm not done removing videos.. The app is wonderful. Other than the fact that it needs to stop forcing live videos on me . my foryou pagesuddenly has become completely irrelevant to the content.

It's an amazing App. The only problem is sometimes I view a good vedio but when I accidentally hit the back button, I lose the video never to find it again.. I love tiktok so much but I have bad habits with them. I spend too much time scrolling, but that's not the apps problem, it's mine. I just needed to warn you that once you download it you can't stop !! Also, the for you and following thing is stuck on my screen, even if I'm not using it. You can see a little imprint. To me it's funny, for some, no.... Tiktok is a very fun app! It has lots and lots of videos for you to enjoy, but my problem is that whenever I post a video on my Samsung tablet the video quality becomes extremely bad and like other phones like iPhone quality is so good! So if yall can fix the quality I would be more than happy. And also when the quality becomes bad the sound also becoms weird in comparison with the original sound released, so would yall be able to fix that. It would mean the world to me!. This app is best.But as videos are repeated time to time,there is the problem of knowing the actual time of uploading videos.because of some important news are also uploaded on Tiktok by meny tiktoker,this creating the confusion on past and present news.so I want the function of snowing time of uploading of video on Tiktok to clear the confusion.please..... Decent app. And where a free app will usually hound you with intrusive ads that you have to watch for a certain time before you can clear or move on, TikTok doesn't do this. It shows a few ads but you can scroll past with no wait. Also it's very addictive so be ready to lose lots of hours in your life on a daily basis.. I love it, this app helped get over rough times.

BUT ever since it's updated the videos are slow, the sound carries over from the last video played and keeps replaying, you swipe for the next video and it doesn't play, the lives get stuck on one motion pic. I've restarted my phone, quit the app but I believe it's the app it's self acting weird. I'm not liking it right now.. Stupid Experience. I'm trying to use some features from many days! Please fix it! I can't use my own music, latest feature aren't available to use music, video is going under review for no reason! .... Fix it please. Thanks. The one thing I really liked about the app features is the captions. They help me be focused and watch the videos without getting frustrated. Lately all I've been is frustrated because NONE of the videos on my fyp have captions, and I'm supposedly able to turn them on myself, but I don't have that function! I can't watch tiktoks for longer than a couple mins without getting a headache without the captions, please fix!. So, I love this app, trust me. Love finding new creators and seeing all the diversity across the wholw app. What I DON'T like, is the fact that all of a sudden when I'm filming a video, I hear NO SOUND whatsoever from the app. No playback from my voice, no added sound, AND the option for text-to-speech is just GONE. Weirder yet, if I actually POST the video, the sound is all there, just not when making it. All permissions are set up, I know it's not my phone... What do I do?. I have once again reported the lack of notifications to Support in app, and have not gotten any further. I did get a few responses with attempts to troubleshoot, but the last message was a month ago. I have reached out at least once a week but have not gotten any response. I can't even get a response that they're working on it. This is happening on Samsung 21S Ultra & iPad mini. I have even tried creating additional accounts and I might get a couple of notifications for a couple of days, but nothing long-term. It's is extremely frustrating that I cannot any type of response from Support. I can't even get notifications outside the app of new messages waiting for me from Support or of liked comments. No types of notifications come through. My settings on my devices are set correctly.. It was great at first, but like a couple others, starting about a week-ish ago (I noticed it on the 24th) I can't hear songs or my voice when recording, or when it's in drafts. I have tried everything, and I Can only hear the sound when I post the video. I am on android and logged into my account on an apple device and it does the same thing, so it's something wrong with my tik tok account, and not with setting. I reported it as a problem, but tiktok has yet to do anything.... I love this app! However for the last 2 weeks every time I try to post a video it slows down the whole app and when I can finally upload z the video comes up with a glitch.i reset the app, Everything.it works for a video then is back to glitching.please fix it I need followers please. I've been enjoying this because (most) videos had captions, auto-captions really, which were useful, since I'm deaf. However, they have disappeared, and there is no option to turn them back on under Accessibility settings. I sent this issue to Tik Tok a few days ago and have heard nothing back.. I used to LOVE this app, but now the algorithm is messed up. I searched now already for 2 days things i like, trying to change my fyp. BUT IT NEVER WORKS. I tell the app videos im not interested in but it still gives me videos like those. I am really disappointed, and sad. I really thought that tiktok was still good like the old days.... App is fun, but some things, like UI, or various \"features,\" are usually beyond annoying as heck. For example, the constant getting notified for \"Lives\" is so obnoxious! I have un-installed, re-installed, cleared cache, signed in and signed out, and combinations of each (on top of toggling the settings for both, individual accounts I follow, as well as in-app settings, and still just nonstop \"so-and-so is live\" notifications. I even get notifications for people I don't even follow. I hate it.. It's really good app, but I have lots of issues using the app as a creator, in the creator tools a lot of buttons are not available to me, buttons like tiktok next, promote and so on are not available, it's so frustrating I have updated the app but still the same thing how can others use buttons that I can't use, that's discrimination please do something about it. I give 1 star because of this. I've had no issue with the app until recently. Everything works fine, except for my sounds, as similar with other users. I can still save sounds, but I can no longer listen to them in my favourites, as they simply have no sound sometimes, pause halfway through or do not repeat anymore? I tend to listen to my sounds all the way through before using them to make sure they are the correct ones, and the recent issues are preventing that.. I really enjoy using this app, but unfortunately recently I've been encountering a problem where I can't send any tiktoks to my friends! I had this problem when I first got the app, but it was just a matter of connecting my phone number. Now my phone number is connected, and I have all of my information in correctly, but it's still not letting me send anything. I really hope this gets fixed!. I loved this app until recently. Idk why but when I try to make a tiktok you can not hear the sound at all during the recording or even editing process. You won't hear any sound until it's actually fully posted. This makes it extremely difficult to even create anything on this app now. I know I'm not the only one dealing with this issue either please fix this.. Lost numerous features like being able to look at people's playlists, \"hide videos with this sound\" doesn't work at all as I'm still getting my fyp flooded with a particular sound and I've missed a lot of videos because it doesn't ask when you try to refresh fyp. This app has been all over the place. Only using it to follow my favorite creators, but even then they're getting banned because people who don't like their content mass report them, which can't be fought. Get it together.. I have not been happy ever since I downloaded this app, firstly my profile pic won't be visible no matter the number of times I have uploaded a pfp, secondly, my sound was removed from the app while uploading my video for some copy right reasons and I tried re uploading it again with some sounds from TikTok but it wouldn't upload, I am sick and I have only spent two days on the app!!!!! It's annoying!!! You lots can do better!!!!!!. Everytime I like a video it does not show up in my liked videos. I wanted to share them with my wife and all my liked videos for the last 2-3 weeks are missing. I only got the app to share funny things with my wife. Pretty disappointed that the app only lets you like a certain amount of videos and after that you're out of luck. I would recommend making it so every video a user likes can be seen in their profile.. I really used to love this app but it is so buggy now that it makes it no fun to use. NONE of the effects work on my phone. I have the Galaxy Z Flip 3 so it doesn't make sense why I lost my effects but my S10+ didn't have any issues. I also can't edit sounds or even use text on my videos anymore. Watching tiktoks is one thing but being able to make videos with all of the features is what pulled me into the app in the first place. This has to be fixed before I try to use it again. Very sad.", "pos": "Negative reviews:\n- The app needs to stop forcing live videos on users and the content on the \"For You\" page has become irrelevant.\n- The app constantly freezes the device, which is frustrating.\n- When trying to remove videos that are no longer available, the app glitches and takes the user back to the top of their favorites list.\n- The video quality becomes extremely bad when posting from a Samsung tablet compared to iPhone.\n- The app repeats videos frequently, causing confusion about the timing of uploads.\n- The \"For You\" and \"Following\" tabs get stuck on the screen even when not in use.", "neg": "Many users are frustrated with the app's recent performance issues.

Always have used Yahoo, only a few problems here & there, but thats over many years time so overall, I would say that is better than excellent.. Handy way to get news and videos on the stuff I. The deal of the day is pretty great the way that it links into my email. wish there was full inbox in the app.. Best App Ever! This app makes it seamlessly easy to check in what's happening in the World News while also being able to check email communications.. I always have preferred Yahoo over Google or any other source. I really like their news articles, web browsing, and email.. bn wit Yahoo 4 long time. Enjoyin thanks. Super COOL INFORMATION app. Super COOL INFORMATION app. Yahoos great, i love all the additions the app has to offer.. Well it's about time y'all finally figured it out!! Sorry for being so harsh about your app but, it's the only way to get people's attention nowadays especially businesses attention. You ignore the trolls and listen to the real criticism. Good job!. I have had this app on nearly all of the phones that I have had well actually two out of three smartphones had Yahoo news. But when the phone I bought broke down after 5 months and I got a replacement refurbished phone there was no Yahoo news! I just realized that I've only had the phone about 3 weeks now and I was sick for two of those weeks. So I just noticed it and I'm downloading it now and I give it five Stars because it shows both sides of the fence. I have used yahoo since either 02 or 03. It was my first email account i had. Even though i use a different Yahoo account now, I still use Yahoo to check the news and local weather.. Great to be part of this deal and thank you.. I think its great that I will be able to live a lot better then i do now..... Im blessed. i like yahoo but it made everone ticked off they made yahoo messenger absolete where we cant use it anymore they shut it off july 2017 which is wrong and gay smh smh at yahoo company. you really ricked off alot of people by shutting down yahoo messenger smh. it easy me ty for we eej I'll. Yahoo is a cool app I don't know what I would do without it!!!. Well done on previous repairs!. I love it it's a 5.. Always like Yahoo", "neg_reviews": "Why would you make an app that wont support mail for a ymail email address? They're yahoo too. Seems I cant use the app at all. It just keeps telling me to use a Yahoo email adress. Not cool. Responding to developer reply: The suggested article doesn't mention or address my issue at all. Disappointed to have the issue deflected.. Can't even leave a comment on articles. Any time I try, it tells me to sign in. After I sign in and try to leave comment again, it tells me to sign in again. Every time there is an update, it makes the app unusable. Already tried restarting the phone and re installing the app.. ADS!!! LOTS OF NOTIFICATIONS, mostly on things I don't care about at all! Inside the articles, especially ones with videos they've now got FULL SCREEN ads so you can't see ANYTHING EXCEPT THE ADS! And, if you want to rewind or fast-forward the video even just 1 SECOND, BAM!! ANOTHER 30 SECOND AD! EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU ADJUST THE VIDEO AT ALL! !!! Their news is 99% clickbait trash, stolen and re-branded from other outlets w clickbait, and they're biased left, no biggie to me, just a FYI though. cant log into my account. like yall erased it sucks.. I am so upset with yahoo right now, I recently got a new phone number, I had no idea I was not going to be able to have access to my own email after that, every time I tried to login is asking for my old phone number to send a code \"I NO LONGER HAVE THAT PHONE OR PHONE NUMBER\". i have contacted yahoo customer service and they can't help me not even if I pay the $12.99 premium. I have the write to have access to my own personal information and Yahoo won't grant me access, it almost feels like yah. Update: app crashes. The worst app I've downloaded. Very SLOW. Email is useless. Now, I can't even access my emails. Tapping the envelope icon does nothing. This app has a mind of its own and does the opposite of what you want or does nothing at all. Can't log out of email, ridiculous. Will be deleting this mess of an app. Not even worth one star.. Switched to this app from Mail app, because Mail app was so slow! This one was working pretty well for a while, but now it's just as SLOW and glitchy as the Mail one now! I may have to stop using my Yahoo email I have had for over 20 years just because checking my email is such a HEADACHE! Come on Yahoo, this has been going on for far too long! Gmail app doesn't have this issue for me!. Stop telling me I need to sign in to report people; I should not have to sign in to report people breaking the law!!!!. Stop telling me I need to sign in to report people; I should not have to sign in to report people breaking the law!!!!. I searched for yahoo calender. This app was the first one to come up, it does not have yahoo calendar in it. It is dead to me.. For the most part I don't mind the app, but I hate the grouped message thread does not show me every email in order unless I scroll to the bottom of them all. So, I turned it off, but now there are lots of individual emails from one person instead of any thread of our conversation at all. Also the past few days when checking emails, if I hit \"show more\" to see what I replied or the last reply, the app force closes. It is very irritating. Hopefully this can be fixed soon.. why do I need 5 Yahoo apps and this one and none of them actually work as advertised. like you literally have to have sports, news, the general (this one), mail and finance to actually get all you need. thanks for hogging my phone's memory and you wonder why Google has the lock on everything but mail.. Yahoo has lost all my trust. I recently got my yahoo email back after yahoo deactivating my account for \"inactivity\". After getting all situated I realized that for some odd reason my yahoo account won't receive emails unless they're from yahoo. I have tried everything but nothing works. If you have had the same problem please help me. I'm having this problem with yahoo mail.. This app is making me mad I havnt got in this app in a long time so I tried to log in but the app says unusual activity and it tells me to verify it's me by going to an account I no longer have access to please help me I need my account back if I get my account back I'll give you 5 stars please. This app is becoming a pain in the a**. Had to clear the app cache and clear the search history constantly to keep it running smoothly. Had to click on the Trash can constantly to make sure its emptied before the trashcan icon finally disappears before logging off. Becoming a time waster doing all that. Keeps crashing. Keep it up and I'll uninstall this crappy app!!. I have this app because it somehow keeps me from having to log into my Yahoo Sports app every single time. As far as the app itself goes, it is awful. constantly sending me extremely biased stories. Not once in years have I received one that was right leaning. occasionally I'll get a near neutral one but mostly just conservatives are awful pieces of garbage type stories. do not recommend unless you hate signing into yahoo sports every time.. I can't gain access to My Yahoo E-mail for some reason, . . . It seems that evidently, I need an Account Key to gain access to the App so that, I can check My E-mail Messages on a regular basis but I continue to get denied access to those messages for some reason due to the fact that I don't know how to get to \"the Account Key that I need in order to see the current messages online.. This app broke a few weeks ago. UI no longer responds to short or long presses. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. No change. Why did Yahoo break it ? Using an Android tablet.. My goodness!! This app is super frustrating!! Tried to delete all these emails that are old and took forever for the old ones to load. App kept kicking me out after I selected all the emails before I could delete only to have to do it all over again to load them all. Then I deleted app and reinstalled and that did fix the app kicking me out, and after it still took me about 40 min to load all emails to delete, only deleted half! Now I can't even open any of my emails. Worst app by Yahoo. Says news & mail are all in one app, but this cannot check your email. Still makes you download the Yahoo mail app to check your mail. It has news, but only a fraction of articles the actual news app has.

I have not ONCE run out of chips and I do enjoy the challenges that are associated with joining a club (even though some club members don't help with the challenges). But I wanted to leave a good review for this game considering that while I was updating this game to earn 2.5m chips I read a lot of bad reviews. :). Huuuge Casino is THE best online Casino I've ever played. It makes it exciting to become a Billionaire. One of the best features is ths Gambling Clubs. You become friends with other players, in real-time, with chat functions to communicate, also in real-time. Download now and Join me and my team, Dueces Wild, for Huuuge payouts to all team members. You cant help but to love Huuuge Casino!. I will give 5 stars when my game opens up. Ever since the update, many times when I try to open the app it will say unable to download game data, something like that. The last time I was able to turn my phone off and back on again and it worked. Not this time.I was playing huuuge casino just fine until I went to make a purchase , that is when I noticed I had a problem with my Google play balance, I got that fixed. Now trying to get back into the game and won't open. Very entertaining. This is a great casino app with so many different slot machines and more to unlock through leveling up. Sound, graphics and effects are very nice. There are a few ways to earn even more chips daily and with progression. The slots feel rewarding and keeps you hooked, though after the last update, winnings seems less. The community is kind and i was able to join a club with ease. All in all, this is a very fun, entertaining and addictive app.. Overall Huuuge Casino is a very good and fun playing experience. But I find some of there promotions to be more frustrating then fun. The current promotion is Casino Fever. For at least the last 2 weeks, I have needed 1 item to advance a level. During this time while playing, I have been awarded other items, but not the 1 item I need. I have had this same experience in prior promotions. Being awarded hundreds of items that I don't need, but not the one I want. This makes for a poor experience.. So much fun! Love the video games. I have enjoyed playing and sharpening my card game skills on here too. I've been playing for almost 11 months or so, some days you win and some days you lose. Just like in a real casino! You don't have to buy chips, just be patient! Clubs are not that hard to get into, just research them before you join, or change if you don't like the one you're in. I've advanced into the high 200's level, no issues getting there. Not sure what the others had problems with.. Love this game. Enjoy playing slots. Enjoy the club I have join. I have been playing in Huuuge Casino for a little while now and I really enjoy it sometimes you have to go to different rooms to build your chip's up but that's where you meet more people, thanks for such an enjoyable game.. normally slot apps let you spin two or three times and ask for feedback before you even have a chance to get settled. i've been playing now, quite a bit, for about a week and having a real good time with got pays and exciting games. also quite a variety. easy to give this game such a high rating. also clubs and social interaction make this an even more enjoyable experience.. It's a good gm site for friends and a good place to be on a good team to meet new friends... they could loosen up the slots a bit though!!!... like i said before like my team and my friends here but do the slots have to be this tight?. My fav slot game of 2018-19! Love the club experience - all members working together for quick rewards plus a weekly tournament with rewards. I would like to see better ticket rewards tho. The bronze tickets for long time players is almost useless. But, overall a great game! Keep it up!. Fun game!! Too many slots though. Still wanting Craps!! Come on it's a Casino!!. My experience has been awesome \ud83d\ude0a thank you for the new awesome games which makes it so much easier and fun. The tech support team have been awesome and helping to resolve problems. I enjoy relaxing and playing \ud83d\ude0a.\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc83. so much fun to play and feels like a real casino. I love it since I can't get out much to casino. it usually pays big too. one of the better ones that I've played and keep coming back to. I have deleted my other casino games. This has great graphics and fun to play. My only negative thing is that they need to loosen up on the wins. I'm on fixed income and cannot afford to buy more chips. Other than that it's a fun to play. Huuuge Casino is the best slots in town!. So far it's worthy of 5 stars \ud83d\ude01 there are a lot of buy now pop ups but that's to be expected from a free game and at least they don't interrupt game play. Nor do you have to wait through a dozen of them between each new game just to play. The games are fun, there's variety, and so far the payouts are favorable. I'm only at level 17 though so I don't know if they stay that way. We shall see \ud83e\udd14. this is for sure 1 of the better free slots games in the play store, that I have found so far. and believe me I have tried quite a few. the winnings are good, as far as the amount, and they seem to come quite often. im sure that might depend on your pick in which slot you play, but im guessing on average they pay about the same. definitely worth giving a shot.. This is about the best game ever! It has all of the feel of being in Las Vegas I love it in the comfort of my own home couldn't ask for nothing better and it's exciting because you do have a chance to win this just really fun fun exciting and just I'm enjoying it very much so, will tell my friends about it, download the app it's great!!! You have hours of fun it's really addictive the app is great!!!! LJ. ( biggL). Love it but I wish the lotto was more giving and when you've reached level 900 you shouldn't have to fight to stay in the upper billions I would still spend money I'm more likely to spend money when I do win rather than when I do not win. I have been playing for a year and a half. People who are reading my review I can tell you this is an awesome game. Just find an awesome team with players that have lots of chips. You win a lot off of the events and the jps from the other players. People are saying bad stuff about the charms but I have actually won BILLIONS off of it. Just play smart and a lot. Yes I lose a lot but get stupid sometimes lol. Really is a fun game and you meet lots of awesome players here. Keep it up huuge!!!!\ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf40. This game is fun and you don't run out of chips, cause the wins are huge. I'me backeveabl to tell folks to Play This Game, the league play makes it more fun than any of the others, it changes the way you have fun when you play. I't been a few months since my first review and I'm still playing huuuge.In league play the rewards for spinning as a team are unbelievable, it's some of the highest paybacks I've ever gotten, a good team makes the difference, I've collected over 300million for one day .. Fun game if you love slot machines. Theres even some table games you can play. Plenty of chances to win big!", "neg_reviews": "You will notice a lot of gold puzzle promos...x7, x6, x5 etc on the normal win of 10 billion. This is a massive money spinner for them. I for example have been on 3 gold puzzle pieces for 3 years now. In that time I have had over 1000 gold tickets to get the final piece.....I still remain on 3. Be wary on the offers of 10 gold tickets for 6.99 etc, you can see from above, it's a terrible con. They will of course respond it's all luck etc, but go ahead and buy, you will see for yourself.. Update! There have been some i.provements of late that made it so that increased my rating from one to three. Now, I will see if the current charm promotion allows people to complete it. I needed only 2 charms to complete promotion with 55 days left in promotion. However, they tell me I can not buy or trade to get them (the ones with gold around the name of the charm). So I will see if that happens. I usually get at least 60 charms a day. I should be able to get the remaining.. I've been playing for a couple of years and back then I would have given this app five stars!! but with every update this once awesome app has become less and less fun to the point where it is now nothing more than a huuuge money grabbing rip off!!! I'm very sorry to say it but I do not recommend downloading this game unless you are prepared SPEND!! Huuuge won't let you win anymore, nowadays it's huuuge themselves that want to be the winners!! if you ask me their antics make them total losses\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\ude24. Stay clear. Relies heavily on investment, bombards you with ad after ad, enticing you to spend spend spend. A very greedy company. Defnately some better casino games out there. From what I've read from other reviews, I'm not the only person not enjoying the constant ads, I've not had the pleasure of dealing with their customer service, but plenty of people have commented on how poor they are too. Total cash cow, steer clear people.. Love the club, met some awesome friends. Be warned, the higher your level, the more you will hate it. Packages are too expensive, my cheapest is $99. Ridiculously high requirements for events and to achieve them you have to have unlimited money to spend. Also, when you spend enough money you become a VIP - that's a conditional VIP. You get a bonus but it's based on how much money you spend on the game. Supposed fast support but I waited 2 days for a response from vip manager.. Keeps restarting mid roll so I've been losing large bets. It's been a constant problem over the last month. It's almost impossible to get all the parts for their collection. The higher you bet the better the cards. I understand pay to win. But this is not it. The more you buy the higher they charge you next time. It's not like we are getting real money!! It's just a giant scam. The trading is too high, no way to get more coins to trade. Its a Lose-Lose game.. The game has taken a 180\u00b0 turn, and not for the good. The game loses connection constantly after you win, you can contact customer service, but they are absolutely no help. They claim their payouts are the same, but that is absolutely not true as I can give several examples of how they have changed their payouts, especially with their lottery. The game was so fantastic, I loved playing it and spending money willingly, now, most of the leagues boycott on certain days because of the changes.. the game is only free to play when you're starting out. once you run out of your initial ships if you actually hit zero the game literally becomes pay to play. Because you can't get any chips until you actually put some money into the game. the ticket lottery is a good idea on but being able to get those only on level up or if you actually spend money into the game makes the late game play pretty much impossible if you ever run out of chips.. I come back every year for the last 6 years in hope that this app has returned to when it used to bee great..But every year I am more and more disappointed as it just gets worse,which I always think is impossible but they always prove me wrong..The slots are so tight now..Will not be bothering to come back again next year as it will only of got worse again..Very sad as it used to be my favorite game by far.. years ago!! Good bye ..I will keep my memories of when your game used to be the best !!. Update: This game has an algorithm set for EVERYONE to lose and to NEVER complete. Once you are in a group you will lose more than you win. The algorithm is set for any person who has won on their system will spend their own money that you CAN OR NEVER WIN BACK! They are breaking the law and I can't wait for these guys to pay back the money they have stole from the people they have stole from. Their response to negative reviews are autoset and are repetitive, don't believe me just scroll down.. I love this game, but the odds of winning or even advancing to the the level after 70ish are just about impossible no matter what game or how much you play. I do believe the game is just designed to get you addicted to it and for you to buy coins with the hopes of winning and advancing to the next level of the game. First off this is NOT A REAL CASINO, but at least first let us win and have FUN and then more people would buy your fake coins to play your fake games because I would be one of them.. Win rate is horrible. I'm supposed to reach level 200 in thirty days to receive currency in another game, but that's absolutely impossible. If you see that offer in Tapjoy, don't even bother. Update: I played every day to the best of my ability and still only managed to reach level 139 in the 30 day time frame. So yeah, it really is impossible, don't waste your time.. Even with fake money to be won you'd think the slots would at least keep it interesting so you can play for a bit. It's a major rip off if you spend real money. Also they've tightened the frequency of acquiring a bronze,silver or gold puzzle piece. You'd think they wouldn't be as tight as real slots since,after all...it's fake money. So for that... I'd give it less than one star if possible.. This game is awful. The creators of the game dont care about your satisfaction one bit, just worried about how much you'll spend at one time. Charms are a joke i've made multiple purchases at once and still not a single charm i need. You'd have to spend like $50 to get 1 charm you need. Worst Game Ever its just a app to fill their pockets with your hard earned cash THEY ABSOLUTLY DONT CARE ABOUT YOU, THERES NO SATISFACTION PLAYING THIS GAME. Zero wins for WEEKS AND IM ACTUALLY MAKING PURCHASES. I used to love this game. When i first joined i was able to hit regularly and even a couple of jackpots. Since the change to workouts, nothing. Not even small hits. I was at 52 billion whrn workout started and now down to 1 billion. I would occasionally purchase in the past but no longer. Tired of throwing money foen a rat hole. Found another casino game that is more user friendly and will go with it.. It was fun at first, and you can level up really fast, until around level 50, then it really sucks. You have to sink your own money to progress at all and the daily bonuses and 15 min bonuses are a complete joke. I've been playing 2 days now and have gone up 1 level because i keep losing. If I'm pouring this much money into a game, i better be making real money back. This is ridiculous. And save your garbage canned responses unless you plan on making this game suck less.. Don't waste your money or time! Game is better than before but still experiences very frequent disconnections. The other issue is the absolutely non existent customer service. You get an automated initial response and then nothing. Money was spent on this game but they don't seem to care at all. I messaged in game support with nothing but an automated reply. When I finally did get a reply from support they refused to help and were obnoxious and rude.. 14 Billion Wipe Out. Another HUUUGE take down. STILL No change. Rating stays at 1. Just when I thought it was going well, it destroyed my position AGAIN!!! Just plain sucks!!! Love the games. Hate the lousy payouts.. Dont bother. This game has changed dramatically over past year. They claim it is designed like a real casino. However we buy with real money, and they take and take and take. Dont get suckered into downloading. Many people i knew on this game have departed past 6 months and it seems the departures are accelerating. All are stating they buy everyday and no payouts, people are spending thousands on the game and get no where. It is a giant money grab. They even implemented arbitration disclosure. Stay as far away from Huuuge as possible. They have become the worse slots on the web. Why they think having slots lose all the time would make a person purchase chips is beyond me. Why would I pay to lose my money? They were fun at one time but no longer. If I'm playing but angry that's not someone having a good time. Every new game is worse then the other. Don't bother with them.", "pos": "Players rave about Huuuge Casino Slots Vegas 777, highlighting the thrill of hitting huge jackpots, especially on the \"Huuuge Link\" machines.

Fantastic interface and clean and clear. I also like the way the game is being developed gradually. Kudos to Miniclip for another fantastic game. One complaint to the developers: the game sometimes logs me out and I have to log in again to continue with my previous/current credentials. One request to the team: could you make the lucky shot option once every 12 hours? Regards.. This is such a fun game! Thanks to the developer for doing a great job of matching skills pretty darn fairly. I particularly love not playing against a computer, but a live body. It's an awesome way to kill time while waiting for meetings or appointments. I give this a big booyah!! Would like to be able to be part of a team, tho, and bigger rewards. Gotta love that friendly competition!. Addictive. Game interface, points system and the realistic sounds make it one of the most addictive games in the recent times. thanks to the creators. Few things i would like to add: if a lower level person wins against a higher level person points could be doubled. If the opponents 9 pucks are still on board points could be tripled. The purchase of strikers (through either points or through payment) is not motivating at all because they are all in the same level in one or other feature.. The game is very good and it is good for time pass. I loved the concept of variour strikers and powers. It has made the look of the struke phenomenal. However, like the last month the season should be carrom pass event there for each month. So, that one should get some rewards after completing each level in the carrom pass whether they have purchased it or not. That promotes the players to play this game. I hope we will receive similar kind of update soon.. I love the game never heard of it much less played it before until about Two weeks ago. It at first looked like it was a easy game but it turns out not only fun but a challenging game. One second you think you got the game down and no problem , you'll be winning alote no one will beable to beat you , and just with a snap a real player comes aboard , that's win you learn real quick that beginners luck is just that beginners luck. If you like fun , meeting new people a challenge , then this is it!. I am getting coin of seeing the ad, during playing I automatically get out from the app and sometimes when I win I don't get added coin or I loss. I whats algorithm problems is going on. Developer should see this. But now after updating carrom pool app, I suggest you make some championship or 4 players tournament. So, it will be more interesting many of my family and friends are playing this app. Hope you will develop soon my suggestion. Some more development you can do like time pause unfriend. The game is really awesome, I am editing my review. Just one suggestion though, there are many players who do not break the pucks even if it's their turn first, rather wait for the opponent by letting go. That's unfair. There should be some rule or settings that if a player goes without breaking or even touching the pucks more than 3 or 4 times, he should loose by default.. nice game. physics are too good. i am on level 14 but i have some queries to ask you 1) whenever i am on winning condition the opponent left the match and i have to wait for my winning lable. 2) please balance the economy: i can't get gems rather than leveling up. i feel that there is no importance of coins specially when i were tried to equipped a new stricker. balancing of economy can gives you a great RETENTION.. Awesome app and a very excellent time pass. The best part is that all age group people can play and enjoy it. Update version is also out of the world. I am really enjoying this game. I suggest that it should be desighn to play offline as well in the disc pool section, also when the network is week we have to play that buck again which is sometime unbearable, rest everything is ok keep it up.. Overall it's a good game. You can play it with your friends as well. There are some changes that I would like you to bring. 1. Please bring an update where we can use our own strikers instead of the one provided. 2. Please bring some more free avatars. 3. Make the ad system more fair as it gives some people more coins whereas others get less.. Update: Exciting new features added such as carrom pass and they are irresistable! Excellent app, hours of fun with new features that are added regularly. Free coins every three hours, free coins for viewing ads, chests with every win and lucky shot everyday keeps us hooked to the game.. Exceptionally good. It's one of the most addictive games out there. Give us more Exceptionally good. It's one of the most addictive games out there. Give us more match styles and more emojis or something of that nature. More messages in the chat also. Plus, allow real cash betting . It'd be so fun and perfect with that.. All things are well and good. Graphics, physics and orientation are superb. But one of the shortcomings of the game is that you can not play with your friends in higher levels like Dubai Skybar, Karachi Arena, New York Square and Singapore Plaza. Please add this feature to the game, so that we can enjoy the game even more by easily donating coins and diomond to our friends..

I like it because it's modes are good it's background is good but there is a problem is that you have to provide more modes and there is also Internet problem in this game then all things are good . There is also a big problem that there is many ads . When we win a match the ads come , this is a big problem that we are facing up. This is my point of view and then all are in your hands. Bye .............................................................................. Good I like this game but the hard work is so much hard to get great reward in carrom pass and the powers also and the striker and the puck so hard to get pls make it easy. very well made and playing online is so much fun. But it still has an annoying bug where you are made to loose even when the opponent has left the game.. Very nicely designed with many options like standard carrom, pool & free style. One can acquire better strikers & extra power by in game purchase or swapping coins, but this is skewed towards developers; meaning you are forced to buy gems to acquire. Positives-keeps you engaged & improves your strategic skill. Negatives-addictve, at times you feel system built-in is more against than for.. Very engaging and good time pass. At times your opponent is naive,they simply push the striker without touching any coin when they see no chance to pick any one. Sometimes it is frustrating. So if possible,there should be a rule to atleast touch the coin otherwise fine should be imposed. I am enjoying it very much.. Its a very time killing and best game for any android phone. It is having very small errors like it gets automatically changing from carrom to discpool after finishing game. It's good design and many different types of levels for chasing your friends after joining with them. New update has power levels of different skins which are very attractive for the strikers and works good.", "neg_reviews": "A worst game of all times which encourages cheating rather than sportsmanship. Developer should play it before use. Since I have truely rated it. There is no option to rate it zero otherwise i would have rated it zero. Same as earlier remarks. Same as earlier.. I love playing this game a lot. But since last few weeks, I'm facing lots and lots of issues. Game does not load. It's always buffering. Have to uninstall and reinstall it again. Sometimes it works and most of the time it does not. Kindly look into the issue. Giving 2 stars for now. Once the issue is fixed, and game is working fine, I'll definitely provide a better rating.. Have experienced some glitches in the game. Developers not willing to address the issues. Merely said it must be a fault my end with connections etc. However this is not the case. Shame, as I still enjoy the game. Enjoyable game. Genuine skill required, not just a game of chance. However, some experienced players are evidently maskerading as low rank guest players, which makes it unfair when you come up against them.. Idiot game\ud83d\ude20 !! The ads are sucks , if you download it for the first time you will never see any ads but after one day playing this game, the ads are just gonna let you mad .Even my phone lag because of ads .The ads are displayed while playing the match. Please Stop showing this much ad guys , even after playing one match the ads are shown . Why ??please Stop \ud83d\ude4f. Sure the game is time consuming but as you level up the connection either slows down or game shuts down by itself. I don't want to give it any star at all. The game shows that the connection is slow during a match. And during a critical moment the game just goes out. I was just 2pucks away from winning. Either it's being hacked or the game just supports cheating.. Slow connection. Game ends with opponent winning in the middle. The game algorithm is faulty. The stricker hits the puck but it doesn't go in the direction it should go normally. It is designed in such a way that you keep on spending real money for strikers, powers, coins and the more you do so you keep loosing and become frustrated. A simple game of carrom is made in such a manner! Uninstalling it now.. too many advertisements in between games.. Damn.. dafugg Too many many ads, one ads per one match, even it is shown that it could be skipable after 5 secs but it wouldn't work, that's a fake.. you must wait at least 30 sec. So.. don't download this game.. plus.. they will bite many of your daily pack.. you developers wicked people.. just go to hell\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c. Totally fixed game. When its my turn and it's a 100% opportunity to bring the win, the game server pauses the game and makes the opponent win. I had faced this situation multiple times in past. The company is focused on driving advertisements with a higher priority than enjoying the game. It is a totally unfair game. I quit playing miniclip's games.. I loved the game. But now I hate it. Cause previously in this game ads were very limited. During the next updates ads were increasing. After every 2 match there was a mandatory ad. But now in this version of the game, after every single match there is an ad which can't be skipped before 5 seconds. So annoying. You have got the popularity of this game just because of limited ads. Now you are going to lose it just because of excessive ads.. Game is absolutely good but the worst part of the game is ads .There are too many ads are coming and those ads are note properly running.Ads are Freezing and have to restart the game every time .after every match an advertisement is coming and it ruined the best experience of the players.If the advertisement comes a little less in the game then it will be more fun to play.. App is nice. But advertisement after each and every game is really frustrating. And also we could not close the ad before it load the browser and page of the ad. So we need to close the ad first and the browser also.. which is not in the previous version, after update it is only shows ads and ads. Till now i could not find any hacker in the game, but sometimes i could not understand that without aiming how can someone put the pucks in the hole instantly.. It is fun and love it .... But there is some glitches... sometimes it reduces the score you secured and sometimes it anounces the 'opponent wins' when I'am still playing the game... sometimes it happens that I am striking a puck and I striked it and waiting to get the next chance to strike it but suddenly the striker goes to the opponent and my points that I secured reduces.... I hate this ..... The game is amazing! It's addictive,and really fun! But the reason why I'm giving two stars is that every time I play,it is always a pro.Its just so maddening that pros are getting the noobs and easily get coins from them.So please make update that if you play,you will be matched with a guy/girl who is equal to the level of you.Other than that the games just amazing!. This was one of my favourite online game but recently I am getting *PISSED OFF* \ud83d\ude21 by the number of ADs they are showing after every game !!! Irrespective of whether I am winning or loosing, one thing is constant -- AD. Please I would request the team to fix this issue or else lots of people like me will be quitting your game. I was the first one to give you 5 stars and now I am giving you 2 stars. Just think about it. The game is amazing but I find it hard to believe that when there is guest player on your level join, he never loses. Seems it is bot. Also, sometimes when you are about to win, your internet connection gets slow and the other player wins the game. This has happened with me quite a few time. I am not sure how it happens in the middle of the game. Seems there is an algorithm behind that game that makes sure to make people win so that they keep coming back.. Although I had an awesome experience, I like the app very much, but lately I am experiencing a very vague issue. When I open the app, it just shuts off while opening and it gives a message, close app, send feedback. Then I have to uninstall and reinstall every time when I need to play. Kindly fix this issue and you get a 5 star.. The game option got stuck, different city chose is stuck with only one option to play on Singapore level. Belive there is bug in game, can teachnical team look into this issue. Then there is too much of add in the game for every option. Eg. You win watch add, you lose watch add, any daily gifts watch add. It's irritating.. My experience On this game is very bad. Ads show top on the carrom poll & automatically strike go to the opponent. Most of the time, opponent's time was over but still they played or striked. On the contrary, Maximum time automatically i loss whatever I also play good. Ads are very disgusting in this game. Please,update your game lest i should uninstall this game.. Good game. Almost feels like playing for real. I felt good about it and thought paying for their hard work by buying premium carrom pass. Then I came to know, legendary striker can be unlocked through carrom pass only. I bought again next time and next time and next time but it never gets unlocked because every time a grand master chest opens one new striker will come out and as the cards are 4/12 or 8/12 the striker does not unlock.

As the people who said first, this game has got too many adds. Its fine but it is too annoying. Could you please remove this adds and add more skin as soon as possible. And i wanna say that this game is one of my favourite game and also the company of this can see what we ask from you. And thank you to delievering such a good game. I love this game it is fun, enjoyable and interesting.. Such a great game, it is really fun and somtimes even surprising. You can choose to seek or hide, I prefer hiding more than seeking. However, I've already brought all the characters from a long time ago. Maybe you could make new characters or other things to buy. Anyways, it's a great and fun game, it is still fun even though I have brought all the characters. Just a little recommendation because I know other people already brought all the characters too. And why did you remove the stairs??. This is a great game! But there are a few things I would like to change about it. One, the ads. There are a lot of ads and it is pretty annoying but I don't really mind it. Two, we could increase the timer on levels to like a whole minute. Three, I would LOVE more skins and it would be AMAZING if you could create your own skins! Maybe you could add hats too because I think hats would be cute :). Great game,not too many ads,very fun too.I recommend this to anyone.You can choose if you want to be a seeker or a hider.The seeker has a pretty easy job,while the hider's job is a bit harder.I think anybody would love this game,and the good thing,not much ads.I think anybody would love this game! You should try it,if you like it,thats good! :D. The game \"Hide 'N Seek! Is very interesting and excellent game but whenever we are playing or over the game the advertisement is waiting for . And the ads are of 30 sec till the ads over we fill to just uninstall it . So I just want to say that the advertisement should not there . But the game is fantastic I just love to play it . Only there should no ads. And there should be no use of internet if it would be offline then it would good . Please do something and solve are problem . Thanks. This game is fun to play! This is my favourite game ever! But hopefully they gonna remove adds.. They say the ads are control by Google. Hope they gonna offline this game. Cause i don't like online games well, but great app! Thank you for creating this game Directors..! I really like it! There so much levels! I have a trillion coins! Hope you download this game and enjoy don't mind there reviews in 1 star.. i don't mind the add well, it just controll by GOOGLE.. This game is perfect and amazing and best game ever but 1problem it is having 1000 of ads if you guys wanna make your game better so plzz remove those ads . And the other settings are amazing what a great job . I wish this game will be most famous in the whole world . Really this game is perfect . I love hide and seek . Amazing Job \ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d . Thank you The best game. This is a very very good game. It's good but after every level ads come and that thing annoys me. My suggestion is that you can download this game but ads are annoying so it's your own choice. By the way i'm giving it 5 stars because i like it but because of ads everyone is uninstalling it btw thanks for reading.. It took a long time to install but it was worth it. There is so many different skins and pets !you get to pick if you want to be the seeker or to hide.I would recommend this game to people who like challenges. Bow I am going to tell you how the game works ,first you have to pick if you want to seek or hide,then if you pick to seek you cant see the hiders so you have to walk around and find them if you get one they go in a cage and the other hiders have free them if you get 4 or5 you win. Love it!! There are no problems about this game, and I love how you get to save other people. Also I love how you can choose if you want to be seeker or hide! I saw some complaints about ads after every level, but that doesn't happen to me. Most definatly recommend this game!!\ud83e\udd17. I really love this game. It's kinda funny with the characters, and I like how it's super easy and it's just great for doing something for a few minutes. I wouldn't spend hours playing it, bc yes it can get boring, but I haven't uninstalled, bc it is really a great game to play from time to time. Great job creators!!! \ud83d\ude0a. It's the best game first thing that we can chose that we seek or hide but in other games not second thing there are boosters that are given the game like speed, invisibility,can pass through the walls nd there are difficulties also like paint,water,. And third thing it doesn't take time to free of other players and fourth we can chose skins also. I have given this game 5 stars but I have some problems like there are some new features added to it which I don't like at all new features like now its showing that buttons which are showed in car racing game which I don't like , please remove that new features.. This is the best game i have ever played.It is so amazing But it has two main problems.The seeker is only the squid game doll and next problem is the ads.Every minute there is an ad.I will be very happy if you fix this two problems and make it offline.. I love this game \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4c. We can buy new skins. And the skins don't cost much. The highest rate is only 1200 I think. It's very fun! But you should make girl skins also. Because I'm a girl and there are only boys or animals skins. 2nd thing, You should make this game ONLINE. You know, it would be so much fun then. And a chatting option also. If you will do that, THIS GAME WILL BE THE BEST! So please..... Thanks.. TIPS FOR ALL WHO IS HAVING A HARD. TIME! Okay so, When the seeker comes near go near the teleport, If the seek commits to go through the teleporter, run to the teleporter on the other side, you can run to the teleporter on both sides, make sure not to get caught while running to the teleporter, TIP 2 If the seeker is gonna get you, run through the doors and go around the map than go into the teleport IF, the time is running out make sure the time is at 3:00 seconds, free people and win.. This game is great although i don't see too many ads...and that's the great part! You can choose to be a seeker or a hider. I would perhaps recommend both are hard jobs, for example, the hider has 3 seconds to hide and there's not many places to hide, just walls.Then the seeker counts down 3 -1 and then you have to guess where the players are. I love the game its really fun. Download this game!. This game is awesome its to good And i think there is no problem at this game But one thing I don't like ads When I pleay 1 stage ads come first 30sec that it double 60sec you need to fix it but all things are awesome so I am giving this game 5 stars congrotulation. Amazing game!!!!! I live it and have no complaints. If you are thinking of downloading it don't give it a second thought. DOWLOAD THE APP NOW!!!!!! It does have a little adds but l think if you like the game don't see if ads are there or not as there are very little games which done have adds", "neg_reviews": "The game is great , but ads , we have to buy premium in order to remove ads but most of the people playing this game are kids who can't pay money... There are literally ads every 3 seconds , so annoying , try to reduce the amount of ads for god's sake.... Was fun for the first 5 minutes; but that's as much credit as I can give the game. The huge issue with this game is the barrage of ads that play, you get ads after every single game, you get ads DURING gameplay, you get ads when you win, get caught, etc. Ads that play during the game also lag your phone. Not to mention the multiplayer is fake and you only play AI despite the game pretending to be you vs others. You need internet connection solely so the game can run ads, not for playing online.. I would give this app 5 stars if it didn't make me watch ads every 30 seconds. Would give it 0 stars if I could. If someone saves you, you literally have to watch a 30 second to 1 minute ad every time. I get that the developers need to eat, but this is ridiculous. Plus, like Joaquin said, this game has wack controls. If you like games that bombard people with ads and have uncontrolable controls, this is the game for you.. The game is very addictive and fun once you start playing it, but I just wish it was more enjoyable there's Too Many ADS! I understand you have to get money off the game you create but at least make the game enjoyable and more fun for people to play. Next thing is that I wish that the levels were more longer, we literally get only 30secs to play which is really anoying. And last, is i think you should change this game into a social game where we play with real players, these in this game r bots.. The game is amazing and fun to play. My only problem is the freakish amount pf ads. I spend more time on ads than the actual game and at times the ads just kept coming and made my game to lag really bad. I didnt really get to properly enjoy the game because of then. Until this is fixed then i don't recommend downloading.... this is a really fun game but after each round theres an ad, i wouldnt mind having to watch an ad every 3 or 4 games but right now theres way too many. i tried turning my internet off to avoid ads but theyve made it so you need to be connected to play which is stupid. this app is just made for making money and the developers dont care about the actual experience. take my advice and download a different game. Very bad! Writes offline and requires data. Many ads! After clearing some levels , phone starts hanging and you will get caught. Controls are fine in start but after some levels, they are so bad. Many other apps stop working because of this. Kind of virus! You can enjoy the game in first few levels. Afterwards, it is a total trash! Hate to this game!. NOBODY SHOULD DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. This is game is totally full of ads. You spend more time in watching the ads than you actually do to play the game. The game is very boring. You'll die of boredom while playing this game and the hide version is really bad. Also, all characters have very slow speed. Please don't download this game.. It's ok, it could have been better if it didn't have an ad every level. This could have been a Great game if it didn't have a lot of ads, Plus a joy stick would have been nice to use, having to use your finger can be very buggy. Such a wasted opportunity.. Game is fun but honestly the amount of forced ads just killed it. I don't know if the dev still working on this game but the amount of ads makes me think their goal is to get a player watch ads as much as possible before uninstalling. Could have added online feature, sell the skins or have tournament. Really missed opportunity here.. This is nice game but it diserve only one star because it contains many ads we know a game need a ads but there is limit I cant play a single game .........If I tell u true it disere 0 star .....I am giving star to it just i want to message to the head of game I really aware that games have 1 ad or 2 ads but I cant play a single game to this ......Who is agree to me said (yes) I saw first game to do like this ......u disvere 0 that is right \ud83d\udc4d\u2714\ufe0f\u2705 ...... This app is not recommend for people who want to buy it. And I have five reasons for every star. Number one, There is so much ads. Number 2, why every time you finish a game and ad comes up. Number 3, Even if there is ads why show the same ads over and over again it's boring. Number 4, Maybe we can create our own backgrounds in the game. Number five, I dont see why this is so easy I am on a very high level and the levels look and seem like level 1. Thank you for taking your time to read time.. It's a fabulous game and I loved it. But one problem, it has toooooo mannyyyy ads. That's only the reason I gave it 2 stars. I liked that when we start playing, we are given to choose do we want to Hide or Seek. It's good when we play it. But if u choose Hide, and when u are caught by the Seek'er then it becomes a problem. How does it?? Let me explain.... \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24 When u get caught by the Seek'er then no problem, but when someone makes u out of Seek'ers caught... Then what happens is Ads \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24. This app is ok I like how there is an option to choose if you want to seek or hide. But there are too many ads when I die I don't want to see an ad so I press play again but I STILL get an ad . The main reason is why it got 2 starts is all the ADS . And sometimes it says it cant find an ad and it takes forever . So I think it should NOT PUT SO MANY ADS WHEN I DONT WANNA SEE AN AD I tap play again so I don't need to see an ad i don't wanna become invisible or skip the level . NO AD. I like this game, problem is the ads. too many ads. like 5 in one round no point playin and the game needs wifi just for the ads so wont work to turn off wifi. uninstalling. It's a really fun game but there's no way to save your progress like hooking up with play games if you happen to remove it for any reason. Had a few earned skins on it and progress so nothing to get majorly worked up on. Would be nice to get my items back if I had to remove the game for space or due to inactive play. Other than that, don't download it if you want to keep your progress. Downloaded it again after a break and so far my purchases have remained. (Thank god). It supposed to be a great game. Only if it can be played offline. Making this game need internet connection just to play it is so stupid! Its hard to create a game i know but you dont to force others to connect to the internet just to play it when theres a ton of ads going in the game. Buying the no ads is the option to get rid of it but it sucks cause you need to connect to the internet everytime you want to play this game and that part is just so stupid!!!!. It's a really great game but, if I suggest can It be play. No connection bc if there's a connection it's just barely Seeing too many ads, I can't play well bc of the ads, and then when I turn off my WiFi it just \"no connection\" me:so what do you want Me to do just wait the ads stop, I just barely delete this now.. -. I hate the controls because they are hard to use. The graphics are cartoony so they don't look realistic but I like the actual game cos' if it had good controls it would be fun, there are also loads of ads and I hate ads so if the developer doesn't remove ads in five days then I'm gonna delete this game, the controls are hard to use because they are tiny, Thanks for reading. Could've been enjoyable if I could play. All the ads in the middle of the game ruins the whole experience.

Imma talk about the goalie today cause this role is crucial in every football game. 1. There's still a bug where the goalie just wait for the ball to cross the line and only then, they will dive for the ball. 2. Please add an update where the goalie can make a double save. The one right now can only make 1 save. You're lucky if that goalie can make double saves. 3. The goalie need to get up more quickly. I only complain about the goalie because they rarely get a big update.. This is one of the most amazing games i have played!! Everyone say that the graphics is bad, but what i have to tell to them is - i don't care about graphics and the best part of the game is its targets, to achieve it or to max your team, you have to do a lot of work, which makes the game not at all boring....In my opinion everyone should try it.. Excellent game. But some things have to be rectified. 1. Yellow ball sometimes hardly visible on the grass. This is annoying. 2. Scouts are useless, because it is not possible to search a player for the certain position. 3. The reason to develop accomodation is unclear. Level 1 hostel is enough to maintain 22 players. With the strange system of random training, the player is not interested in buying too many players. 4. It would be nice to make letters of players positions bigger.. The game is one of the best if not the best football games. As for the career node, I think that at the beginning of the season, players should start with full health, and that that when players are on yellow card suspension, the card should only be valid for a certain amount of time. However, this game has changed. For starters the gold coaches only give a plus 3 boost, instead of the plus 5 that it used to be. Also, at the half time of every match, there are always annoying ads popping up.. Love the game, graphics are cool and it's just very fun. I like this game better than fifa 'MOBILE' and pes. This game is probably the best soccer/football mobile game out there.. One of the best football games. I can give 10 out of 5 \ud83d\ude01 for the graphics and gameplay. Yeah at times it is so difficult to win the all-star European champions \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6stage. But with good players in the forward and mid, It is sure a piece of cake . Only drawback is the higher price for buying coins. If it is made little bit cheaper. It would have been great. Otherwise this stands the best \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcaf. I love the tremendous improvements on the game. It's become more difficult to play, and this is very good. However, I suggest there should be an open transfer market where one can trade players and get more coins for players traded, just like the real transfer market. Also, for each competition, the gem should be more.. Honestly amazing, I would actually give this four and a half stars cause of only one thing, Money, you never have enough coins to buy players or upgrade your stadium, it also costs too many diamonds to buy kit styles, please lower kit editing costs and add a few more variations next time, other than that, this game is pretty good. Oh, and also, please remove ads during half time interval\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0e.

The app game is so nice...good work done but now why is it at times that my opponent pauses the game that even when I am leading on the score board and he or she goes to be awarded the points. When the game is paused it brings about network instability. Thus the outcome. I also see it if it was possible for having the option for a player to request a rematch with the opponent.. I have some observations: 1. There is no option to sell a player. I think the availability of getting point by selling a player should be incorporated. Thus we can buy a new player by selling the old one. 2. No point table is available in latest version. In old version, I can see the point table before each match. If I want to see the point table, I have to go to the statistics of my team; which is very much erratating.. Great game, I am regular since 2016. My recommendations and feedback: 1. There should be exhibition mode where we can choose mainstream teams and play with them. 2. There should be a difficulty level. Plus, in formation/team management, an option of player roles/strategies for each match should be given, eg: LM to run forward. 3. Instead of release player, you should add sell player. Prices could be higher for players to cater to creators commercial interests. Thanks. Hoping for feedback.. Great game you got out there. Love the Graphics and stadium effects as well as the look alikes of the players, but I would like you to consider these to make the game improve 1. I have noticed that you don't use teams from the Bundesliga which I don't understand. 2. The offline mode can become like a place where players can choose the teams they want to play with 3. Please the commentary is too old style so plz update it or even change the voice of the commentator. But apart from that game=\ud83d\udcaf. It's a very good game but it's lacking some features like goal celebrations, it's embarrassing to see Leo Messi doing CR7's celebration and could you bring back the \"create your own player\" feature from DLS 19 ? It was really nice creating ourselves. And one more thing if it's possible can you please add career mode , it would make DLS one of the best in football games . And could you add other Bundesliga players and some of the legends like Ronaldo , Beckham.etc. Please try. Thank you. Dear DLS and co. why don't go according to the consent of the players who used to play and love this great football game...why the player's energy ruin so much after the half time...even if I spend 30 coins still it again goes down by 70/75 min.earlier this was not like thisand when the gk comes out of the box to kick a ball which is one side,then the gk always kicks the ball in such a way it goes out and gives away throw in why u don't make them hit straight in the middle plz fix all this\ud83d\udda4. I'm so much enjoying the new update. Every single thing is on point. Great graphics and a great gameplay. The only problem I have with the game is, during LIVE MATCHES, my players are unable to move and it always causes me to lose the game and the buffering too is just too much during LIVE MATCHES which automatically forfeits the game. If there can be a way to solve the problem, I would be happy.. Super game but I have a little problem. When someone is playing offline mode and decides to play exhibition instead, he should have the chance to select any team he wants to use like bayern, chelsea and other teams instead of using his own squad which may arouse his or her enthusiasm for the game. Please fix that.. This game is nostalgic for me because I was one of the first users to play the FTS DLS game; it's been 7 years, and this game has helped me a lot in difficult times; the developers have shown me time and time again how they took feedback and improved a lot overr the time, kudos to the development team! Keep rollin guys, you've got a long way to go!!. Playing this game since a while now. Lot of improvements need to be done to this game. Skills should be improved, commentary should be improved, more teams should be added, try to avoid scripting some matches and let it be realistic. You guys are mostly just money-oriented and the progress of graphics in the game is very very slow. Be a little more satisfactory to the player and come up with some better graphics and game play.. It makes you know what soccer is about. It's fun and to me when I play it makes me calm down. Also, It doesn't just have it where you just play. You also get to buy players and rebuild your stadium to make it bigger and cooler. There is alot of other things you can do. What I'm trying to say is that it's a incredibly fun game to play and very enjoyable to play. The one thing you will like alot about this is that there is like NO ADS that interrupt you while your playing. You should INSTALL NOW!!", "neg_reviews": "After u guys test the update do u feel satisfied with it? Cos there are so many things dat do not make sense. Like u press B to tackle and ur players pause, wait for the opponent to go past dem before making an attempt. Does not make sense. And as to how ur players suddenly become soo unresponsive and so slow, I don't get. I think u guys should try the multiplayer matches for yourselves.. This latest version of 8/3/2022 is boring, 1. Players are getting tired frequently. 2.pictures are poor not realistic like the previous. 3. My players are slower than before. 4. Defending and even challenging opponents is harder than before. 5. Picture is showing smaller than the previous version. I've been playing and upgrading my players from one step to another for more than three years. If these problems aren't solved, the I'll have no option but to uninstall it. Kindly assist.. 1.The game commentary I thought was going to change 2. I feel like something is preventing the defenders from pressing with an attacker on the line, like a Barrier....... They are always beat no matter their speed 3. The kick assist (direction) is purely off dls22 was supposed to be better than dls21 but the reverse is the case\ud83d\ude13. This game is so infuriating to play. The AI actively avoid whatever player you're controlling, the refs are so biased towards the other team, your forwards are always offside. It doesn't feel like a fair game, you can outplay the other team but still lose because the game is programmed to make it easier for the other team. It feels so unfair, there are a million other soccer games out there don't waste your time on this Garbage. Terrible game, would rate 0 stars if I could.. Generally, the game is getting better. The AI is more challenging but annoying. And the refs are insane. Because they would give us a yellow for challenging AI only by pressing B, but they wouldn't even give AI any cards even if they tackled our players till injured. Also when we're under attacked, we couldn't even control our players as well as we always do. I do like this game, really. But, if it's still rolling this way, I'd probably delete it soon.. I hate this game now because a lots of errors is in the new update. 1. Sometimes the buttons stop working or players kick the ball without been directed. 2. Poor control of the ball. 3. AI players still have more effect than players like Costa, Bale, etc. 4. You don't get enough coins per match. 5. Players get tired after first half of a match. 6. The network of the game is always lagging as also the game. I have abandoned it until there is any change in the new update. Rubbish game. This game needs fixing. It became the worst game. My players are slow, they can't control the ball properly. This game seems to favor the opponent. Also, there are too many ads. Every time I go to half time, it's an ad. One more thing, it keeps signing itself out since the last update. This needs improvement.. This game used to be very exciting but it has gon down hill. 1. Using coins to buy players then receiving coaches instead of coins. 2. Freezing of controls. This happens a lot and when I'm playing a match it happens then I end up conceding a goal. 3. Players get tired too easily. I hope these problems are fixed or else I'm deleting this game.. The new update was the worst thing that has happened to the game. The so called \"new tactics\" are stupid. The keeper comes out too often, the players have slow reaction time. I've been playing this game for 3 years now and i know how long to press a button but now the slightest touch sends the ball flying. All players seem equal now be it gold or blue, a white player overtaking a fully upgraded mbappe? Unreal, also the players get tired too easily now.. The game play is very good,but the problem is the control button always stop sensing in the middle of the match,and it keep saying that DLS 22 is not responding....I really don't have a problem with graphics,but please fix the ads and the control problem...This game deserve 5 stars but I'll give it 2 because I can't play the whole match due to too many Ads and controls problems\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude21....First touch group you have been the best in terms of delivering good football games,so please fix this game\ud83d\ude4f.... I do love this game. But, when we play career mode, it's only challenging in the very beginning. I mean, when we already have superstars like Ronaldo, Messi & etc., this game turns to such a boring game. Why? Because the gameplay doesn't need any of our skills or strategies. The only thing we need is to fill up our team with all superstars and upgrade them. When we play a match, we only need some strikers with high pace to score. And, the second half doesn't matter as it does in the real life.. I gave it 4 stars upon release but it's significantly downgraded after much tampering and updating. I can't play on smooth 60fps without lag anymore. I tried reducing the graphics and frame rate to fixed 30fps, but that didn't stop the stutter. It ran smoothly and beautifully before. This new update messed with things a bit. It's not as fun anymore.. Sometimes when Ad is shown clicking the 'X' button does not work. No matter how long you wait. You'll be force to close the app. No bonus coin will be given. Some Ads that counts down from 15 or 30 will also freeze. There will be no counting. You'll have to restart the app to continue.. such a nice game. The more you play, the more you get more experience, just like in real football!!! But it must be said though, that, Sometimes the buttons just stop working when you are one on one with the goalkeeper, all of a sudden the goalkeeper just grabs the ball from your feet because you could not kick the ball. The recent updates you did are absolute nonsense!!! Why must defenders run from attacking opponents??? Why do players lose so much energy within such a short space of time? Bye!. True story. I've always liked Dream League Soccer. A *LOT*. Been playing it since 2017. But tbh, from 2020, the game has become simply terrible. It lags like HELL. And don't give me that \"old spec\" excuse. It's a Snapdragon 855 device. And the Offline DLS runs absolutely fine. God knows what they did with the main version. Not to speak of the terrible AI. The AI can do whatever it wants, but if the other player does so much as a slight tackle, the guy gets yellow carded. Very disappointed.. 1. Ads show during half time which doesn't add to your coins. 2. You can't buy a specific player you want but random ones shown by the game. 3. Game becomes faster than normal sometimes. 4. Low earnings per game and yet expensive players. 5. When you sell your players you earn nothing. 6. The 2022 update made it worse, the computer you playing against won't give u breathing space, they're always with the ball. 7. Ball always hit the bar most times if you want to score. What a useless game.. After updates I can happily win an online match even with a 5 star team. I even find it hard to win a 3 star team, my players are automatically slow, players can't stop the ball successful without the ball leaving them, opponent players are automatically faster than my 5 star players\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 this is really funny. I don't I leave from tie 10 to tie 14 and can't even win games? I usually had clean sheets from tie 14, 13, 12 and a 11 but now the lowest rated players can play more than my players.. Game RUINED. What's gone wrong? EVERY tackle is now a foul/yellow card! The financial rewards are now far too meagre, so progress is way too slow/difficult. Instant substitutions no longer happen. Directional arrows for free kicks : inaccurate. Goalkeeper ignores goal kick arrows & kicks straight ahead! Often to an opponent. Free kicks are basically pointless. Why can't you CHOOSE which player you want coached? You should be able to use your in-game wealth to improve your players.. Honestly, the major reason I am yet to uninstall this game is because I have invested much time and effort in growing it. I would have opted for anything lesser than a star. Fine, we have been managing the playing style for more than a month, this recent upgrade is totally useless. You do be barely booked from a tackle behind, the energy drains more faster, I don't even know. The game seems to be unfamiliar. It sucks, I prefer playing dream league soccer 2015 to this. \ud83d\udc4e. A lot of improvement is still needed. So many things are just not right, a lot of manipulation. From the game control, to connection to server. For me, the oldest version is better than this. The game is worse than before. Now, opponents make multiple rough tackles in the box 18 and don't get a red card or any foul. It's getting worse guys. A rough tackle by the defender on a potential goal should not be left unpunished. Fix this guys! I will surely give it any thing less than 1 star.", "pos": "Negative reviews:\n1.

I absolutely adore this thing!!!! it's ease, the function, effects, the filters they go on and so easily it is so easy to lengthen or shorten the effects, better than any I've used thus far,!As I said there is not a whole lot you can't do with this app and do it rapidly and easily this is a must-have,!!!!! What the heck are you waiting for download it now!! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4d. At first this was really confusing but the app has a tutorial for everything you need to edit a video I even learned how to make cool transitions, put cool stickers in, and also put text into my video. I've tried a lot of editing software in the past but this app has made it so much easier than any other app. I would recommend this to anyone that needs it. Just trust me you'll be amazed on how great this app really is. I wouldn't choose any other app.. Dev responded, and while it didn't completely answer my concerns, I just learned that they added the ability to split audio and you can adjust volume more precisely that way. You can check the edit for more info, and it was added and I just didn't know about it, so my mistake. Anyway, with everything included, I'm upping my marks with this revelation. Thank you for the response / program and take care. -b. Very good app best one i have used an i have been looking for this type for more than a year an nothing compared to how good this one is (HIGHLY RECOMEND!) yes you have to pay for pro but its still good even with out. An the split an trim transions effects are wonderful( if they could add borders to flicker that would be good as well if they wanted to add it in) thank you for the app keep it up if i could give this 10 stars i would!\ud83d\ude02\u2705. This was the only video editing app I could find that did both freeze frames and video reversals. I'm keeping it because it's easy to learn and intuitive to use. I only needed it for occasional product presentation jobs, but the time I'll save makes the subscription good value. It would be nice if the subscription cancellation was made easier to find, but I think that is on Google, and common to all Google play subscriptions.. Easy to use app......more interactive app compared to others but it loads a little slow....the templates are awesome in their own ways....as,I have been using it from a long time I think if I try any other app for editting I wouldn't be able to edit on it,that's why I am sticked to it I would highly recommend it to you if you have good patience. Pretty easy to use once you play around a little. I like that you can easily loop short videos to repeat for a longer overall video (like for posting boomerangs). Took a bit to get used to how to mess with the different editing tools, but once you get the hang of it there are a lot of cool options & ways to use the tools! You can't get all of the editing tools with the free version, but it's still good!. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST EDITING APP I'VE USED! It's soo easy to use! You can in port audio super easily. It has a god amount of transitions for free and they are descent. For the longest time I was using the bare minimum, of what the app had to offer. I recently found out you can animate the pictures, How cool!!! You can also put text over the edit. It has really cool fonts. The one bad thing is that sometimes you gotta restart the app. Also to anyone who's curious you can use gifs.. I am most impressed. I am a professional video editor and: Best mobile video editing app ever. Used it on ZFlip. It's better than the \u00b1$5K software I used to edit video with on a desktop in 2011! \ud83d\ude32 Pretty much any functionality you may think of is included, super easy to use and intuitive. Didn't need 1sec of tutorial. Improved features and lots of new ones. Of course, the '21 desktop equivalent of the \u00b15k apps I am referring to have evolved a lot... But this here didn't exist 10 years ago. 10\u2605. Generally speaking, it is very easy to use, especially the function of automatically recognizing subtitles is very practical. I hope there will be a function. When exporting, you can choose the bit rate and encoding format of the exported video. You can use vivacut to cut the video. Unfortunately, the video volume will become very large. Sometimes a video of several hundred Mb is imported. I wanted to cut out more than half of the useless clips to save volume, but the export is still hundreds of Mb or more, which severely limited my creative desire. It is recommended to improve the compression algorithm and export settings.. Overall, it's still a very good app to use for editing! Even though there are times that an error is popping up and will kick you out from your working timeline on a draft, it's a good thing that it won't really bother you so much. Even if I haven't upgraded yet to the purchased version for the other tools, it's already amazing to use. Good job! Hoping that there's more free tools nyahahaha.. This is one of my favorite editing apps,I love the transitions and it's so easy to make a video to make you go viral on social media platforms! It's just that sometimes when I'm making a video,it just randomly freezes or go back to my previous images I put on there. Like for example: I made this video with some images but I deleted them and put other images but then the app froze and took me back to the deleted images. Get what I'm saying? But overall, this is a great app to use~!\u2661. This is one of my favorite editing apps,I love the transitions and it's so easy to make a video to make you go viral on social media platforms!

But overall, this is a great app to use~!\u2661. Out of all the mobile editors I've tried, this one caught my attention. Really easy to get the hang of. Many awesome video editing tools. Price is good, and they continue to put out new vfx's and smoother animations on every update. Would love to see how far develops take this app. At the moment I bought the full in app purchase to support creators! Thank you for giving us editors a chance. One thing I REALLY hope to see is a feature that allows us to change video hue colors with keyframes. This is amazing for making AMVs. I love how creative you can be with all the things you guys provide with pro. One problem I have with though is that it's very laggy for me. When the video is playing it lags a lot, so it's a bit difficult to see where I need to fix or edit at; I have to export the video to my gallery for it to be smooth, so I can see where I need to fix it. Other than that, it's pretty decent. (Also thank you for replying to my 1\u2606 review when I had my issue. TT). This is a 5 star for now, you can always watch an ad to remove water mark that very very good, i didnt expact much from a 50mb video editor but this honestly is a good contender for capcut/alight motion etc tho i would like to suggest adding graph next update 100% recommend. On the first try I loved the app There are many benefits 1.The most important it does not takes much data if u have exhausted the complete data of the day you...cuolf still make amd export video in a brilliant quality 2.Has the best animation effect it has many more options such as VFX and all this is why I am loving it Thanks to the creator I loved the app. Its a fantastic app! i really love it it just take bit time to learn the edits and all my only problem is how to remove the watermark?ive tried thousand times buy still cant remove it,if so please help me find a way to remove it if its imposible and thank you!vivacut!. I loved it so much in the beginnig, and paid. Great VX effects, for puctures and texts, good choice, easy to use. However - every single time i open it, it shows the watermark (bottom right) and i have to click on it to remive it, it shows that i've already purchased it and i go back and the watermak is gone. I am changing my rating, the problem seems to be solved.. Now I understand why everyone is using this app! It works amazingly! Really considering to buy the pro version, but the free one works perfectly!! I don't rate many apps, this is really an exception! You can cut, ad layers, effects, change speed, add music and the free version lets you export on 720p and 480p. You gotta upgrade to export in 1080p and more, and to access some effects. But 720 works perfectly anyway.", "neg_reviews": "Absolute garbage. I pay for the pro version and every time I report a bug it's never fixed or responded to. Constant crashes, out of sync audio, whole projects lost, corrupted files, general glitchy behavior. I expect better if I'm paying for something. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. You'd have better luck using any other editor. Stay away if you care about editing and quality.. Not worth it. I purchased the 1 year pro option a few months ago. I enjoyed the basic extra features but they suddenly cancelled my subscription and I had to pay again. The app works on a mediocre level, anything too advanced in terms of masking or keyframe animation doesn't export. You'll just get a black screen. Also its practically impossible to send in a complaint. They link you to an email that doesn't have any one on the other side. A steep price for a mediocre at best app.. Dont get me wrong, cool app, it has good transitions and its pretty smooth, but you have to pay for all of the transitions except for like 4 which are the two fades (black and white) and i think the slide transitions (up, down, left and right) I just dont think thats very necessary for an app that people want to use, especially since on the ads it never says almost all of the transitions are priced. Sorry.. So I do fan edits so this was a really great app. At first. There aren't really enough transitions to use, not enough effects, and I would not get the pro, just because of the price. I've been having a issue lately though. When I'm done with it I sometimes forget to save it. When I go back to it, either the audio is gone, or some of the clips I added are gone. I would not recommend, but it's simple to use, I'm going to find a different app though. I went and paid the $40 to unlock the import music feature, only to find out it's broken! Every time I split the track to move one section to another part of the video, instead of the music picking up right where it left off at the split point like it's SUPPOSED to, instead the song starts over from the beginning! This is really upsetting, because it's such a basic core feature, yet it doesn't work. For charging so much money, you really should have a working product, you guys.. I like this app, it works great for me but after the three day trial I was charged 50.99 because of my mistake of forgetting to cancel before that period. I would gladly purchase a month or so of premium but a whole year is too much for me, im 17, live alone in a trailer with my dog and I really need that money for our food and my savings for school. Im willing to pay the days I missed but I really cant pay for the whole year its too much. I need that money back, please give me a refund.. A bit disappointed, I have been looking for a good video editor for a long time, and even though I thought that this one seemed like the best one, it still has some issues. For example, trimming clips is an absolute nightmare(atm I use another app to trim clips and then transfer them to this one) and for some reason, the different clips within the video bug out and get mixed up. It shows a different clip on the screen, than what you are trying to edit on the time line. Very frustrating.. What happened??? Whenever I add a photo to the project it automatically adds a slow zoom to it and I can't change it?? My keyframes aren't working and keep disappearing whenever I go off the project. It won't let me zoom into the photo to change the size of it on the screen either. And a delete button for the whole project is now right next to the duplicate button?? You could accidentally delete something you worked really hard on!! PLEASE fix this. I can't use the app like this.. Do NOT use this app! I purchased it over a year ago and it was fine, infact, I loved it. Recently it is garbage. It just renewed my subscription, big mistake and waste of money!! The app constantly crashes, and it doesn't actually save projects. Trying to retrieve them is nearly impossible some of the time, and most of the time, completely impossible! I have lost hours of work and time! I would like a refund, and suggest fixing whatever was changed that messed up this app! DO NOT PURCHASE!. Terrible. The app Itself is fine but I went to do a free trial of the pro and apparently there is no free trial, So it took my $6.49 Then I decided it wasn't for me so I tried to unsubscribe and I couldn't find where to unsubscribe, so I sent them an email saying \"Hey it's not for me can I have my money back?\" and nobody has emailed me back. So there goes my money... This app is really bad. I downloaded it for transitions at first but then it said that I needed to pay for it. I'm sorry but the app is free and the transitions aren't? A few weeks after that experience, I downloaded it again to try add a video layer into my video. I was faced with a much lag straight away. After minutes of waiting , I received even more lag, I couldn't even move around the layer. Then, it froze. I am disappointed in my results and wouldn't recommend this to anyone. 1/5 \u2b50. This app was awesome. I've been a pro user for about a year now and have loved the app. I've done tons of videos with it, it was super easy to use. With the recent update, everything seems to be off. I can no longer see the total run time of the video above my editing options, there is a slow zoom on every clip you add which is UNBEARABLY annoying. Everything seems off. Please change it back! I loved the app until the most recent update! I don't want to have to change video editing apps.. It's alright. I first used it and it was going well. Editing videos for my youtube channel and all of a sudden it says along the lines \"app has been terminated, contact supporter\". So I do and it loads for over 5 minutes. This started randomly and now when I want to finish editing it happens at the same part every single times it's annoying. Fix or I'm going to have to find another app that will do the job.. This app used to be so good, but since their new animating update, it has been broken ever since. When you try to animate and turn an image by even a little bit, it just spins like six times in the other direction. At this state, its practically unusable, and it makes everything even more frustrating. And now there's a watermark, i give up..... It's a very good app! And I like it its good for editing! I would have given this app 5 stars but...to ME! It seems like all the good features, you have to be a pro! Like literally all the good ones you have to be a pro! You could have at least given us some good features instead of it all being pro, like seriously! All the plain ones are ok but the ones that make the vid pop! are not fee! Like y'all want money that bad? But all I'm saying is please let there be some good features that are FREE!. I don't like it. I used to before the update, but now I can't make the picture move like I used to be able to do. I'm very sad they took that away. To people who want a moving picture, I recommend trying PixaMotion. And note to the developers: PLEASE READ THIS! U ONLY RESPOND TO PEOPLE WHO R \"FAMOUS\", OR THAT GIVE U FIVE STARS!!! :( :( :(. I pay for pro, but after the update the app does not open past the vivcut screen unless you Uninstall and reinstall the app every time. The app will act like its loading and after 10 seconds a pop-up will say \"to ensure data security we need to migrate your data, but your storage is insufficient.\" And gives you the options to 'clear up space' or 'ignore it'. I HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE and Ignoring it does nothing but show the loading screen forever. I lost 2 projects I was multiple hrs into editing.. I don't like it. I used to before the update, but now I can't make the picture move like I used to be able to do. I'm very sad they took that away. To people who want a moving picture, I recommend trying PixaMotion. And note to the developers: PLEASE READ THIS! U ONLY RESPOND TO PEOPLE WHO R \"FAMOUS\", OR THAT GIVE U FIVE STARS!!! :( :( :(. I got this app before and I found it really easy to use and I loved the transitions. There was a new update recently and I was editing a video and when I went to export it, exporting it in 780p was now a pro option. I was pretty upset, and also you can only make it a certain length if you are using the free option? And the pro version is so expensive so now no one will want to use your app. I miss the old version. I do not recommend this app unless you want to pay for it.. Seriously have lost a second sponsored video. Days of work gone because this App is inadequate. The instructions to recover the video given to me by vivacut then deleted the file. This is by far the most expensive app for the value. Even with the strongest phones this app manages to fail miserably. You MUST export after every single editing session or else you risk the video being gone. Why is this rated 5 stars, how many bots do you have to buy because this is clearly a terrible software", "pos": "Negative reviews summary:\n- App freezes or randomly goes back to previous images during editing process.\n- Laggy performance, especially during video playback.\n- Difficulty in removing watermark even after multiple attempts.\n- Subscription cancellation process not easy to find.\n- Exported video file size remains large despite cutting out unnecessary clips.\n- Occasional errors popping up and kicking users out of their working timeline.\n- Some users experienced confusion initially despite the tutorial.\n- Slow loading time compared to other editing apps.\n- Lack of border options for flicker effect.\n- Limited free version tools, requiring upgrade for full access.", "neg": "Negative reviews for VivaCut:\n- Constant crashes, out of sync audio, whole projects lost, corrupted files, general glitchy behavior\n- Pro features like masking and keyframe animation don't export properly\n- Difficulty in sending complaints and getting responses\n- Limited free transitions, most transitions require payment\n- Issues with music splitting functionality\n- Subscriptions renew without warning\n- Trimming clips is challenging\n- Problems with keyframes and project deletion\n- Recent updates causing issues with animations and features behind paywall\n- App fails to open or load properly, requiring constant uninstalling and reinstalling\n- Exporting in 780p now requires pro subscription, limiting video length on free version\n- App prone to losing edited videos, prompting frequent", "summary": "-", "features": "-", "adjectives": "-", "search_term": "-"}, "com.hyperkani.bomberfriends": {"app_name": "Bomber Friends", "description": "Get Bomber Friends now and join the immensely hectic and fun online multiplayer game!

Anyway this the best game ever... And i dont agree this gane has no bug,no internet bug,i dealed with this bug in Beach Event...And when i haved 12 wins,i lost by no internet bug! So i want to fix this. I lost by no internet bug. I would won the whole event!\ud83d\ude215 star. Super Fun!! I love This Game so so much!! I cant stop Playing this addicting game! And I love how you don't always have to play online. You can also play in offline mode! Whatever you did to this game KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS! \ud83d\ude03 What I Hate about This game though is all the adds know they really bug me and they are way worse! I've been playing this game for Almost 1 year and Still I love it.. What makes this game the best is the quick, 4-player vs mode that's always available. Events are also fun. Most importantly, it's not pay-to-win! It still needs an \"are you sure: yes/no\" when you use gems to buy something. I accidentally spend gems on worthless treasure chests so if I spent money on this game it would go to waste. The option to refuse to spend gems is much smaller (I use my phone). I spent a little money since Developers improved inaccurate 4-player mode win/lose rankings.. It's a little lag but this game is fun, you can make a lot of friends, i met my bestfriend and she's really kind, were always playing together, every season has changing, all event is fun and if you win yu'll claim an item, make your skin more pretty hihi i hope yu'll play this too:>. Really love it, have been playing since 2019 on my tv. But one thing, when I want to change my acc to another device, I have to do manually since it doesn't save to google play or my Google acc. Pls fix this bc I keep forgetting it and last time I deleted it, I had to start from scratch.. Very best game ever! But there is a great problem on it... the players are being kicked out from the room when they play better than others...because theres a option that you can banish a player from a room if he or she are showing bad behaviour...so they use that to kick players although these are not showing bad behaviour...just playing better ...this issue should be quickly solved! Sometimes u have just got in the room and they kick u... please... solve this problem ...thanks. Thanks for getting all my progress lost. I was about to finish the lava map in arena and then I was told to log in. I signed in with my gmail and BAM, I'm back to square one. There is NO way to get your progress back. Edit: Idk how but it saved all my progress and I managed to log in without losing my items. This game is genuinely fun, just make sure you log in lol!. This game is awesome this is my second favorite game in the whole entire world you could customize your avatar bombs play against friends and others online. The controls are easy if the joystick is not for you you could go into the settings and change it anyways, sending it and change anything like your username how do you set up things when you're playing. I just want to say you should make more games like this this game is the bomb you should really play it thank you for making this \ud83d\udca3\ud83d\udca3\ud83d\udca3. Great game, though in the arena, players are teaming up to easily defeat others and gain medals easily. If would be really nice if teaming would stop.. Things you can improve upon: 1. The explosions should expand, and not just flames spreading out instantaneously. 2. There are a hell lot of power ups which you could include in the game. 3. The remote detonation powerup is something I really missed. 4. There is unlimited scope in the explosion shape modifying powerups.. when will be new levels updated as i have finished all the level 1 to 380 can u please tell me when u will add more levels??? i really like this game... When this game started out it was glitchy but i still played because it was the first good first version of this game that I had seen since Bomb boy. since the recent up date the have launed themselves in to the present! The ping is fast and the platform is built really well. I play better with something to work towards so it can get a bit still when you have to wait to earn more merch and specials. But I enjoy theextra bounty hunts and comps, i know it always keeps me coming back .. Everyone complaining just needs to get good, if you're lagging check which region you're in and reset your ping, if the lag is too bad join another game. If you're out matched keep playing until you're better than your opponent, and leave the game if the skill gap is insurmountable, you'll get there eventually. The one complaint I have is the kicking aspect. I have many accounts and a lot of experience, if I want to take over a lobby the other players can quit if they don't want to face me.. This app is amazing! Me and my family have a clan which is really high on the leaderboard like 25 at the moment!! I love this game! It is really hard to get to 2800 at the moment \ud83d\ude02 but my max was.. 3096!! Thankyou for creating this game! It is amazing! 5 stars! Deserves it! thank you so much for clear bans \ud83d\ude03. Pretty damn fun, but I recommend playing this with a controller. You'll have a better time.. Absolutely love this game! No lags in multiplayer and the music and the controls are absolutely spot on! One feature request is to be able to have voice conversations with the people in game during multiplayer. It might be too much to ask for but that would be pretty neat! 5* anyway! Thank you for making this!. Ill give it 5 stars-because its hella addictive. I mean my friends and I are hooked into this game and we play all the time. There are certain glitches or probably some problems with the controls but thats ok. The ads are annoying. Like after every single game with random people, u have an ad, so um thats annoying. Otherwise great great great game!. This game is best in the world, i just love to play this game, some of level is really so difficult but i passed that's kind of hard level, i am always be with this game.. I just wanna to know how to save my games in Facebook??? I need to know the why this games not save in Facebook??????? We need new level and new quest level, so that pls adding as our required all the new levels. Thanks for being this Bomber friend games. We are always with this game. Best of luck.. The best game ever!!! It's a little complicated but they tell you what to do and how to play it's so fun and there's different maps and why four star for the control like I said complicated the controls are complicated. This game really meet my expectations! It would be also great if the animations of the characters could change or the body parts to match the artstyle of game itself. Anyway, I do think this game is really charming and fun! Please do make new updates soon!", "neg_reviews": "It's a good game with great graphics. But the ads erased few stars. When i open the game, it'll load nicely then bam! An ad will show up but won't play, the screen is just blank and it took too long to load so i had to close it and try opening again. But it's still the same.. Really enjoyed this game and even bought a pack or 2 with real money but with recent updates, I cant reccomend anymore. I had to delete much of my previous review but it all still stands. For Parents: This game is NOT kid safe. There is a spot for reporting bad language and behaviour but it is either not monitored or there is nothing being done. I have reported the same characters and clans many times for bad language and see them back again & again. A great game gone downhill. It's a shame.\ud83d\ude15. The game is absolutely filled with glitches and bugs that are never ever fixed. But every month they keep coming up with more personalization items and etc that cost lots money instead of giving the minimal attention to fix the game. I think their priorities are very clear and we know what's more important. If you need anything from support you can expect 2 weeks at least for a response. Your questions won't be answered and your issue won't be solved and you'll have to keep sending emails.. so very disappointing i was able to purchased their in apps... but not worth it.... not a good game anymore... it was already a fighting game and not anymore a relaxing game\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20 if only i could rate zero... i would rate it.... At 2019 the game was addictive, fair, nice community, surprisingly difficult campaign. to all bomberman / dyna blaster fans (as me) - good choice! At 2021: joystick stopped to react since a new round starts after 15 rounds, while all other controls is fine, and 180 degree phone rotation no effect (reactions, bomb planting - working, but movement doesn't). Clicking in area of joystick I see \"reward already received message\".. annoyed me a lot, even more than Ad which turns off sound mute... The game itself is fine, but the ads. SO. MANY. ADS. Opened the app? Here, have an ad. Played a game? Did somebody say ad? The ads also cause Spotify to stop and forces you to exit the game, reopen Spotify, and go back to the game, only to get another ad, which stops Spotify. 2 stars until something gets changed. Don't get this unless you love the obnoxious music and ads.. [ADVERTISEMENTS, 040921, Av10, A505U1] Advertisements were added and their is just way too many of them. this is a very fun game except for the fact that and it looks nothing like the original bomber man and I have a feeling the reason why is the original Bomberman may have been under a copyright law but anyways I wish that it look like the original.. Good but way too many be adverts when you first start the game and between levels before getting the bonus and watching an ad for double bonuses. Even failing some levels triggers a long ad you can't skip. This totally be ruins the flow of the game. Less ads would be better. Controls can be unresponsive at times leading to frustrating deaths also icons on the left too large with controls covering them they should be moved. Adds are making controls unresponsive at the top of the screen in game.. Hi I just wanted to bring to your attention that I lost so many points in Area Battle and I can't believe how fast they move and swap me in over the other side and walking through my bombs? I believe the players maybe using cheat code on me. Any ways you can investigate this problem and could I have my last 16 games points back that I lost so quickly by the players cheat code?. Point system is unfair in Arena Mode. Tops 3 and 4, you will get point deductions. Pease adjust this, like Third and Fourth places should have no deductions, as well as, no additional pts. And the EXP pts you mostly get in common chests is only 3 to 4 and it takes a while before you can open the chests. Why not give the EXP pts whenever the player finishes a dungeon/floor? Or add tasks for additional EXP pts? It's also hard to control the game on TV even when using a compatible controller.. This app sucks. Besides having many many ads , there is an ads that always stays blue and didn't even load. I cant play for days because of that. Developers didn't bother to remove that ad and Change it. Excuse my bad grammar but i just can't let it pass. Before this game is my stress reliever but now it becomes my stress. Can you fix it ASAP? I'll rate it 5 stars if u fix it. That's all thankyou. I hope u fix it ASAP. The game is ok but here is the problem first my account was gone, it was logged in and saved within my gmail account, next thing is that there is too much ads, like you cant even skip the ad and it is so bothersome that you keep on exiting the add and it makes me mad because you cant play smoothly, lastly is finding players to fight with, like when you enter a match there are only 3 players and i was observing like if i was going to observe then i should just watched on youtube and not play.. Nice game. But if you don't purchase the season pass it's really unbearable how many ads you have to watch. Really every or every second game. It's rediculous. Matches are usually just like 1 minute long. I'd give this game a 5star because its so good. I know this because years ago I had this game and it was amazing. Now, the problem is that when I try to log in it loads on 30% forever. When I press play offline it says 'Connection with bomber friends has failed' I want to play but can't. Someone please help me fix this.. Pay to Win at its finest. Been playing this game for over 4 years now, and since mid 2019 it degraded in quality. So I installed the game last week, and here are my struggles with it: 1) it took me ~7 hours in a single sitting to reach 2000 medals, yet I was still at level 2 and couldn't advance it any further 'cause \"daily limit reached, teehee\" 2) \"Kicked out of the server\", -34 medals 3) \"Lost connection\", -34 medals 4) lost packs and skins from events I won 2 years ago (horse head). It could be best mobile multiplayer game, but it's pay to grind and win, if you don't pay you stuck with low bomb add-ons, so if wanna play in higher ranks you must pay, they even don't give experience points for playing and winning, you will get few chests for watching ads, and then again stuck for hours, because they want you to buy. Developers you can take money in much more ways, but don't do pay&grind to win, all biggest online games never do like you. Shame to kill game like this.. It forces me to keep watching an AD whenever I open the app. After that it closes automatically, it happened for like 10 times. Not gonna play it if you won't fixed this.\ud83d\ude21. While I enjoy the gameplay so much and it's addicting. :/ Lag is an issue. I hear others lost their items and stats if they haven't logged in a long time. Lag is still sucky. I've tried different connections, but it seems most of the time I am still a tad behind others. Example is when players blink out and are suddenly on the other side of the arena. Emailed video replays multiple times for same issue, but no fix, yet. Usually more bugs then fixes. Now you can die randomly for lose no reason.. I love this game but the developers didn't care about the matchmaking. The matchmaking isn't fair. Everytime I play, the enemies have more trophy and a pro. And in 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 my teamates very annoying, standing still, and getting die. Also the ads are very stupid, everytime I tap like claiming, changing mode, and after playing, an ad showed up and wait for 15-30 sec.. I found many bug and glitches. The worst part is the hackers. They unlock all skin, immortality ,infinite bomb and powerup. At first everything was good I even made a season purchase, After an update my account was lost. I lost the progress..I tired unistalling and installing, I logged out and then in but nothing seem to work.

I was at 4 stars initially due to the amount of notifications i was receiving. I didn't know how to change the settings but ive had to learn because there was a lot to look at. Also I didn't read it but i posted a video first thing but it had nude content and i set it to private and that wasn't good enough.. they didnt catch it so a few people saw it which is embarrassing \ud83d\udc80 but... my bad. Sorry guys. Awesome app. Get it!. With improved views and algorithm, this app is fantastic for sharing messages. Spreading much needed positivity in an already difficult times. The grafics and effects the video recording is great. My only issue would be you cannot upload from other video creating apps ad it does not support this. However I'm sure these community guidelines are to help not deter from the experience. I hope to see whoever is choosing, whether or not to download this app, be socially famous.. After I used Likee for the first time, I was proud that this app was popular because a couple minutes after I posted one video, plenty of people just viewed my videos as they're enjoying them. This app overall, was great as social media. But, sometimes it may take some time to load. Other than that, the app was enjoyable.. I recommend likeeto children and adults above the age of 8. This is because it is a form of entertainment and is such a fun app to use. It gives to a chance to show your skills of singing, dancing etc... and all the other talents that other people have. It gives you the advantages of giving and showing challenges that inspire other people to do. I would recommend this outstanding app to everyone. I love it!. Pretty awesome app. Still getting the hang of it. Well I've been making videos and having some fun with it. And I've seen some other peoples videos and photos and some were very interesting. They did some really great work. So because I'm really beginning to enjoy the app I'm going to change my rating. \u26e4\u26e4\u26e4\u26e4\u26e4 Great work guys!. Enjoyed making my first video. I really love that the news comes from every where! Just amazed! I very new to today's technology \ud83d\ude03! I love the way you cover beautiful and true news. An I am having so much fun with this app. You must try this app. I just may forget all about Facebook! I love this app. I'm singer, songwriter and so much more! I come from the Wolf Clan out of LaPush, Washington! North America! Hi! World! Mother Earth is sacred and so are all of you!. I\u2019ve been enjoying the videos I\u2019ve been watching. I\u2019ve made a few that looked great. Haven\u2019t tried the new filters yet I wish that the videos didn\u2019t keep repeating over and over again. Is there somehow to stop that or maybe let it go to the next. Video. I also wish that there were more older gents and ladies on here and everyone stop staring at every guys down below. It\u2019s 1.)!disgusting, 2.) who cares if you can\u2019t see it in the first place and 3.) this app should be just like any other app. You have to be a certain ago. There are way to many children on here that have to watch, listen, seeing people touching oneself or others. This is sorta becoming like a porn exciting app. I think it should only be allowed to 16 and ????????????????. This is amazing! But i have a few reccomendations: add a cropping feature in the edit part, voice changing mech, maybe a full body effect? Games(not in livestreams), an option to look at some other videos, other than following and popular, and turn down bots. I was streaming and there was a huge amount of bots in the live chat, as well as in videos.. This app was all I could find that could load fast, and supported pictures. I was really lucky to find it. I thought it wasn\u2019t worth it the first time I saw it, but I was desperate for something since I make GLMMs for YouTube, and that involves a lot of photos being taken. Inserting over 100 photos into the app was not hard, I am so glad! Just have a few things to say. The downside is, is that a lot of the features I used in other *video* editing apps, was using music and transitions. Here, I need to buy premium. I am not that old, so I don\u2019t have a job or any way to make money, so I don\u2019t think I can afford premium. Although the feature of premium does sound cool and recommendable, and that you make money off of it, but I am a little bit disappointed. But overall, this app is SUPER great, and I totally enjoy it. I would recommend it to anybody especially for videos they want to share. Now, ads. There are like NO ads on this app, so anyone who says that is not right. Itis super cool and smooth going through this app when all I have to worry about is whether my video will look good or not, and it won\u2019t look bad because of the video editor. Now lastly, I think you should recommend th. This is a really fun app to be able to use your ideas into making a video as well as enjoy everyone else\u2019s ideas. People are also able to express their opinions and emotions to other people\u2019s videos. You can accept friend requests and ignore them, duet videos, comment, like and disable the comment section if you don\u2019t want people to comment about your video. You can tag people as well. A well deserved five star!. I have the app. I enjoy going through the for you page and watching all the funny videos but, there\u2019s one problem\u2026 One huge problem. This app takes up most of my storage and if you think that I\u2019m lying I have deleted almost all of the apps that my iPhone 7 has come with and this is currently the only app I have downloaded that wasn\u2019t already installed. I have. emir 100 photos and 11 videos. I am still getting notifications from my phone saying that my iCloud is full. And no I cannot buy more storage with my family just moving we don\u2019t have the money. I haven\u2019t even fully updated the app due to how much storage it takes.. Many of the videos are excellent source of knowledge where we get to see for the first time; many things, ideas and creations existing in the uni. Ive been using this app (and Likee) for a while now. The camera and effects are cool and they work well. Ive been noticing that since only a couple of days ago, when I use the 2x option and I look at my video, its a bit ahead or behind of what the sound is saying. Thats the only problem I have! Overall, its a great app and other users and sounds make me laugh.. Its the best app for entertainment with amazing features and exciting metrial but I have concern that a lot of issues also facing during using this app and even major issue is that after many complains there is no positive response from the team or company. Which is irritating. Please focus on this issue. Thanks.. Likee is an app where you can do what you want and bless others by comenting! There is a lot of fake users but you can find real users by watching videos! Its very fun.I would not say its an app for kids becuse of the dances and music. There are a lot of haters out there but that does not stop me im me and you are you so stop the hating if you dont like somone juat keep scorlling and dont tell them mean things or body shame them.i love likee i rate it a 5 star!. This app is awesome!!! I can never get my eyes off likee. It is my favorite app ever. There are so many features. Of course there are face filters but there are stickers as well. You can duet a video or react to a video. There are sooo many sounds you can lip sing so from music to comedy. You can do transitions and slow Mo\u2019s and fast mo\u2019s and more. You can even go live and donate real money. I suggest this app to everyone.. this app is great for editing, don\u2019t get me wrong. But, there is one small problem... Why do you have to pay to add your own sound? In my opinion I think itis dumb to do that... But hey this is your app. Itis just a suggestion to make your own sounds free.This is the only problem i have other than that i love this app!. I litarely love this app to pieces I think it's more famliy friendly then Tik Tok I also love how it doesn't copy Tik Tok like it has some features that Tik Tok has as well but they and there own twist on it they have Levels,Touch magic, A very big variety of filters and a lot of other things that Tik Tok doesn't have. Though I it does seem to spam you sort of when the LIKE officials text you that they have all this new stuff but that seemed to stop. So yeah thanks LIKE for creating this app. I am a fairly new user creator, and wasnt sure at first, i do like the in app video editors, but i do find it them tp be a little difficult to correcr it if miss a step its hard go back and fix. Also thi k users need to be aware that there are audio leval options in the final sound editor. SO NOT EVERY VIDEO COMES IN AT 115DB ON MY PHONE. The filters could work better, some are hard to work with making faces or where you\u2019ve got to have your hands in the right spots to start or stop a filter, other then that I\u2019ve only been on a month or so. I\u2019ve enjoyed meeting new friends, some wouldn\u2019t of never met if it wasn\u2019t for TicTok.", "neg_reviews": "This app truly sucks!!! When you try to delete it from your phone it sends you thru a multitude of changes and then, it tells you your account won't be deleted for at least a week! In the meantime, it constantly appears on your phone without your permission!!! Terrible App and I'm sorry I ever installed it on my phone. Just wanted to see what it was about And then it didn't even do would it claims it does!! DO NOT INSTALL THIS GARBAGE ON YOUR P HI ONES!!!. After a couple weeks of constantly dealing with ads popping up whenever I unlocked my phone, and way too often while randomly using my phone, I finally figured out it was due to Likee. Their response: Download & Use those apps or close the ad. Thanks for the complete unhelpfulness. A better solution would be to fix it so that ads only pop up while using the app. Even when I hadn't used it for days, I get those annoying ads popping up before i even get to see my homescreen or what time it is.. The only problem is that when ever I try to shoot a video for the whole body,there's always something that develops under my eyes and it looks like eye liner but it doesn't come straight on(my eyes)why is it so? So I have just decided to be capturing videos on an app called perfect camera and then use them in your app during shooting period.. I Love this app at first but now I dont like it cause they took away the makeup part on it. You use to be able to add lip stick and make up to yourself to look prettier, now it's not giving you that option no more. This app sucks bad now without that. Like why would you take that feature off. I'm giving it one star and I'm deleting it because I dont like it anymore. I'm very disappointed! It was my favorite app! \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\udc4e. Very much not liking this app. I tried going live I'm ( 18) and it blocked me due to ( violation of rules) of a minor. I tried lefting it so many times but no \" photo wasn't clear\" and failed when in fact it was and in fact I didn't break any rules. It's annoying and upsetting to see how it's not working. ( I did do the steps you said ). Not very good, this is one of the weirdest apps, they use the in-built music player in the quick settings in android 11 to get to you, and they say \"hey did you want to join my live\" like it's a DM but infact it's a pain the ass or \"missed calls\" is another one, they will fake a miss call to get you to watch someone's live video Please sort out your act likee.

I love the app, it\u2019s awesome!! There is a great way to communicate too on Likee, and the things I dislike is that, sometimes you don\u2019t get messages on the app from other friends on there as well. I shared tge app to many people and some were like \u201cI love this\u201d and some kinda didn\u2019t because, of the messages thing. I change my mind.... this app hates me. Im done!. I used to really love this app but for some reason i can't like videos, comment, see notifacations, text, or edit my profile. I have had this app for over a year and had no problems till now, please please please fix it!! I dont want to delete it because of how much effort i put into my account. Edit: with the current mode I am in I cannot post videos without it being set to private. If this isn't fixed this app is going to be so deleted my thousands of users including me.. I'm really starting to loose intrest in this app because of some complications I've been having with the sound system. Whenever I go to try and use my own music to make a video and click on the \"local music\" thing, it just says \"no music found.\" It's very frustrating and I hate the fact I can't even use my own music to make videos now.. I have two problems with this likee. 1) Terrible app. Advertisement background music continues playing through app even after scrolling to the next clips, requiring restart of the app. It sucks 2) this app seems to cause people to do incredibly stupid things, record them, and post online for the world to see. I never knew people could be so dumb.. Well yeah I'm having fun on LIKEE, but now that I have been on LIKEE for so long I've noticed that this App needs a lot of work, For different reasons, Fairness, A Under age Child Lock \ud83d\udd12 Bullying Free, More and Better Music, Be able to add your own music, longer time to Do a video, And those that are Host Creator's in Broadcasters Should Get Way More Money for the amount of work they do. So yeah that's just a few things that need to be improved on LIKEE, But there are way more...\ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd26\ud83d\ude46\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude31. I downloaded this app as a result of your Instagram ad where it was made to look as if this app can morph pictures from young to old and vice versa... It absolutely can't do that. This is very misleading and annoying. I've uninstalled it by the way. I wasted my data and time. All thanks to you con artists.. Not happy.Communication and customer service are abysmally poor! Likee claims to be very strict with inappropriate posts, but there are so many in there!. This app is super annoying with their so many guidelines that doesn't even make sense especially when majority of the users are adults, even posting a picture on moments gets restricted because of so called community guidelines and most times you don't even know the reason why that happened, also I thought their recent update will make the App more amazing, instead they went and removed the only feature that I really liked, \"the make up feature\" & put nothing new, like seriously!.. The Likee Community Guideline system is too strict and inaccurate, it makes me delete videos that aren't even what it claims it to be like \"watermark\" and \"inappropriate\" and it makes me delete them, the Likee Official messaging system just randomly gives me a violation which is annoying and fustrating and that i might get banned for false claims, i hope the likee community guideline (Likee Official) gets fixed up cause it isn't doing its job correctly.. This app went down hill after its updates. After this platforms several updates it broke, and will not post any videos anymore. Every video, new, draft, innocent, music, whatever, doesn't matter it does not post. Likee has has turned for the worst and isn't even functional anymore, which is upsetting considering it has been my absolute favorite app for years. Goodbye likee.. I hate this app so much it keeps kicking me out and it is very glitchy. Nothing is working and I'm really mad about it. It hasn't worked since September 2020 and its now a new year and it is so slow. Don't get this app. Its not worth your time.. Likee is a very niche app and it is NOT kid friendly. Interestingly enough it's flooded with minors. It has sexually oriented content and is no place for kids. It truly needs to be an 18 and up only app. But that would cut into your profit, because if it became 18 and up only you would probably lose half of your creators or broadcasters. Whatever the hell you want to call them. Parents of America, get involved in your child's life. See what's going on with this app. I think you'll be shocked..

Adding subtitles, titles, music, effects, trijng, merging, etc. It has everything that a vlogger or an editor needs right in your handset.. I love this app. It's a legend or you can say more than kinemaster. You can make intro , outro , transition , background, posters , and you video amazing. It's best for the youtubers who are shooting or editing their videos in mobile. It has taken my heart. I love this app so much. I am also making my yt videos and editing them with it. Pls download this app. Trust me and it's source - A lover of this app. THANK YOU!!!! This update made my day, it is amazing and I will get used to it soon, but it isn't fully updated as It had gif, many new intros, effects and stuff in my iPhone?!?! Another problem: it's sooo hard to use. READ TO THE END: Decent!! This app is very helpful and easy to use!! It's connected with another app called, \"Intro Maker\"! They work perfectly fine. These apps are excellent to use, if your recording for a YouTube video, If your recording for YouTube, I would recommend these three apps that go well together, \"Free Screen Recorder Screen O- matic\" \"Vlog Star\" \"Intro Maker\"! All these apps together, is better than buying the stick thing you put your phone on to record!! EASY PEASY!!. It's awesome like i found this from my friend as she was uploading videos on YouTube i tried to find more apps but this one is the best..but their is one prob when we try to add intro they ask us to pay so i cannot use intro but otherwise it's best... I really appreciate it..it helped alot for doing editing...i really advise you to do download it for editing YouTube videos or other videos. Really good editing app, lets you do whatever you want. And really good quality. Best editing app by far. Easy to use and great to play around with. I use this app for my YouTube videos, but you can do whatever.. I love this app and the stuff you can use! You can make awesome intros, outros and more! But the only thing I didn't know was that you needed to download an app to go with this app to make intros! Woops, but other than that, I really like the app! There was nothing really wrong with it all I didn't know was there was another app to go with it.. This is a fantastic app! There are no problems for me. This is the most working and most manageable app out of about 10 other editing apps I have tried. Five stars for sure. Although you cant access everything, that is completely understandable because you should pay for such a great app. But you don't have to pay for most of it! Great videos made from this app.. LOVE LOVE LOVE this app! Although my phones ram is extremely low, this app works perfectly and I can understand it taking up about 200 mb of my Space after downloading the effects and backrounds but that's cause i chose to download all of them! Very cool edits and transitions. So professional and creative. I saw YouTubers that used the same edits that this app have. It works without data but i prefer yoy download your effects and everything and then go without data until whenever! Thanks so much. I have a youtube chanell mixplate I edit all videos make on vlogstar. Really this is very beautiful app . I have been using for an year it is very simple app i have share my friends i am really very satisfied with it. It's a very good app for basic video editing. I've noticed that the free version is limited but even so, it's still a nice tool to use for beginners up to intermediate level users who wants to create awesome videos for their vlogs. Good work devs and congratulations. I hope you add more free version tools in the future. That way, people will be interested in getting the upgrade if they feel comfortable using the app at the beginning.. I like this because the sound effects and intro are free you just need to download it and its fast and also it have tiktok templates theres no problem for me in this app so i think this is good for vlogging...just my problem is the transition of letters the other transition is v.i.p so i just keep it but i still like this app...HOPE YOU VLOG USER ALSO LIKE THIS THANK YOU VLOG STAR\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. Nice one..I am enjoying editing my video. In order for you to access all the features you have to buy their plan. Good thing is there is a lifetime plan that cost very affordable. I am wondering if something happened to your phone then the plan you bought is also gone or can't use into other phone.???. Wao amazing app i like it \ud83d\ude0dgood App because I use there is no fake app. Try to get a chance to get a chance to see you tomorrow morning at the same thing as a friend request on facebook and instagram and twitter and instagram and I don't know what I said that you can do it for me and you know how much you \ud83d\ude0d me some \ud83d\udcb0 for you guys are the best for you guys have to be there for me and my phone and I have to do it again and it was good to know if I don't know how to do it again and it was the. I have been using this app for over 2 years now I am really happy with how this functions. I like how much accessibility the app provides to customize your video. Easy to navigate and learn. I would 100% recommend this app to people who are starting a new YouTube channel. This is a great app to start making professional videos all on your phone!. Just the best HONESTLY! 1.This editing program is on both android and iPhone 2.You can make the sizes for what you are gonna edit and make for example (youtube, Instagram, etc.) 3. They added templates so you can make something fun now :) for example: these Christmas templates that give you free access to songs and transitions that are very useful if you want to make something for your family or if you are just bored 4. I can keep going on but I think you stopped at 1 and no more space. So amazing i love this app this will be helpful for you read this\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 My sister download it and and they have effects, text,different styles of text,and a glitch and sound effects and musics Hope its helpful!!!.

Last year I used this app for many of my editing projects. But for the past 4 hours I've had to restart my projects, uninstall and reinstall this app a couple of times, even deleted some files to create space thinking it's my phone. But the app keeps crashing. I'm so pissed man. I take back my 5 stars \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24 UPDATE: LOVE LOVE LOVE THE NEW FEATURES. I FEEL SUPER EXCITED WITH ALL THE NEW THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED.", "neg_reviews": "This is good but it won't let me export on 1018p, 720p, and 480p! And my video is about 1:30 long or more. Please fix this and please tell me what to do because I want this Youtube Video out now! Edit: NOW I HATE IT! I WAS ABOUT TO PUT 5 STARS FOR A RATING BECAUSE IT EXPORTED, BUT NOW IT DELETED, AND THE ONE IN MY VIDEOS IS MESSED UP BECAUSE I TOOK OUT A VIDEO TO MAKE IT EXPORT AND IT WORKED BUT NOW I MUST EDIT MY VIDEO AGAIN, FROM SCRATCH, AND I WAS SO HAPPY , BUT NOW I'M ANGRY!!!!!!!!. I love this app but I've just spent all day filming and editing for it to delete my audio. I've tried everything to get it back and the videos arent on mute or anything but they have no sound. When I put new videos in they make sound but not the others. All I tried to do was put some sound effects in and a voice over, all of which I deleted and they only lasted about a second and then all the Audio was gone. It's very bad that app is very good but any time i just seve my project on it after 6-7 hours that my project is automatically deleted...why it's not even full of day just some hours...! My full of energy,time & effort is waste...every time now it's happening...why why why...!? That's not done...i'm very disappointed and angry too...\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21. I got this app for the react cam and it stops recording by itself randomly after around 5 minutes of recording. Very annoying. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus with 40 gigs of storage available and 6 gigs of ram. This shouldn't be happening. I'm so glad I used the trial and didn't pay for it. If this issue didn't happen it would be the best reacting app.. This is USELESS. I purchased the monthly subscription, but this application really really sucks. It keeps crashing and when it happens all of the videos that I edited is not being saved. There are also issues in which the voice is being delayed from the movement and it's really annoying. Just friendly reminder this app is not worth your money.. Good app but can't export video before geting premium. That is the worst thing of this app. Please change this feature.. My video will corrupt in the middle of editing and there is now way to retrieve like drafts. I keep repeating the same thing over again. The app is nice but everytime it will corrupt, it is really such a waste of time. Please fix this issue. Even if you will continue editing, it will do the same thing.. Charged me 1 month subscription today for 159.00 but I couldn't download any video clips or templates! I uploaded my own video clips but this app couldn't work normally. It's lagging and super slow. It couldn't handle many video clips at a time. * Reply to the respond: Thanks for your generic reply. First of all, I was able to download the app because the network is okay and there's no issues with my google play store. My device is redmi 7a android. I was just trying to edit a 7 minute video.. Well, I'd give it 5 stars if it would stop crashing on me. I emailed the developer on 1/18/2020 and am still waiting to hear back why it crashes so randomly which really affects me getting anything done. I literally have to save like every 30 seconds, because I have no idea just how soon it may crash again. I'm on a Note 10+. There should be no reason for this at all as my phone is plenty powerful to run anything. I am awaiting the developers response so until then its 1 Star from me.. \ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude4c\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude65. After using Vlog star for a year, with many issues, I am very frustrated with the service I am receiving now. A premium subscriber, for over a year, this is not my 1st experience with my access being limited. Now, I find my self having to explain why I am not able to access the features I paid for. Then have to wait 3 weeks for my money to returned. *This app is becoming very frustrating and I'd rather invest in an app I can trust in.*. This is horrible. I worked so hard to make this gaming video. It took me months. So, when I try to add more clips it just crashes. So, because of that I decided to leave it there for a month or two. Now that I check back on my video, it is so laggy and it has nothing to do with effects, it just lags.. everything is good, but it will not let me export the video to anything. it gets to 5 percent, then says it failed and to try again. when I do, it does the same thing. everything else works well, however don't see the use if I cant use the video...... So so so dissapointed!!!!!! It was amazing I edited something but when it came to exporting I couldn't do it because it said the video codec wasn't supported like what!?! After all my hard work . I do not recommend this app because something so important should have been sorted out by now. So so so dissapointed !. Still my issue s not rectified.... it shows, media codec configuration failed.. after subscription it is much worst. It's a good app indeed But the video clippings sometime become invisble(showing black colour) and the audio has also some problems sometimes, I can't joint the clippings as it's not working well, plz fix the problem asap. Everytime used this app and In the middle of my editing for some reason it's always force closed the app which is annoying and some of the videos will automatically deleted and you cannot add it back again unless you reboot the phone. I have paid \u00a39.99 and It is really annoying how some errors like this. Might refund if this problem did not solve..please sort it out..people are paying to have a good sort of editing not a pain for editing. Sort it and will remove my review and change to 5*.. I used to love this app but randomly all the time the screen turns white and my video is erased and it happends every 5 mins so I save it so many times but after the 5 or 6th saved video the quality looks bad and the video doesn't match up with the words! It's my 4th time redoing the same video please fix it!. I thought this app improved. My past issues in this app is still here. The audio, missing clips, the lagging. It's worse. I tried so many times to reach them out but nothing happens. Never gonna use this again.. Very disappointed in this new update, now we cannot edit our videos without the app logo added now..it's very disappointing, there is a subscription needed first for the premium packet wich will disable the app's logo,, NOT HAPPY!. have been using this app for more then a year and now this.. Soo disappointed! I'm deducting 4 stars and moving on!. It was at first 5 stars, then dropped to 4 stars, now a 2 star because ir keeps automatically rotating my videos and when i rotate them back it expands them and cuts off some of the video, please fix for a better review", "pos": "Positive features:\n1.

It's really fun for me. If there are so many ads, then you can turn mobile data off and play. But it takes so time to go from one arena to another after arena 5. But that's not the problem. This game really, really deserves 5 star! \ud83d\ude03 Edit- Wait... Wait... Plz solve the lag problem because I play in very low graphic mod, but it still lags so much.. The game is really fun I've never seen this kind of concept shooting each other's targets is a pretty cool idea. My only complaint is the season pass is a little high. I think it should only cost between 6 to $10 for the season pass and more people would buy it. Also I think this game would be a fun game to come to the Nintendo Switch maybe you could port it one day like modern combat did.. The epic game. I like the fact that there are tons of characters to unlock. The thing I am waiting for is FUSION MACHINE where we can combine two characters. I miss the jump button so if u can add a jump button that would be very nice of you. And yeah, develop new maps and new characters and new features. Thanks for entertaining me in the pandemic. 5star from me :). Awesome game you can switch Tpv to Fpv. Just showing ads frequently if don't get to any real money purchase. I purchased season pass only of 180 rupees and get so many cards box and items. You can also go for the lowest 70 rupee parchase that is also good many items will be given. I know ads are very annoying you just have to purchase anything and what ads will be gone. Somes are are shown only for extra rewards.. Amazing game. Great characters, cool gameplay, nice concept. Love it so much. But my only request it so see this game controller compatible. I just tried it with a controller. It kinda works you can use the super and everything, but you just can't turn the sight camera. Please do this I would love it and I'm sure others would too.. Absolutely amazing!! I love playing this fun and breathtaking game. One of the best parts about it is the fact that you can play on and offline without it affecting trophies!! If you love games like clash royale or kuboom, it is both of these combined! The only peice of advise i would give it is to improve the graphics. Hope you enjoy as much as i do. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. Absolutely love this game. So many characters all with unique abilities and the gameplay is very smooth but....please for the love of God make the movement wheel unlocked as an option. My finger runs off the wheel so many times and I just dead stop in the middle of shooting. Please make it so that the wheel is in position wherever we touch the screen. Would make it much easier.. This game is one of the best shooting games. Some say, that the matchmaking is worse, but I guess that depends if they play numerous times offline, and goes online, and they're in a higher arena level. Not much of ads, only if you need a free spin, or reduce chest time unlock. The best game to recommend, and the best game of Oh Bibi of all times.... At the moment, this game is an excelent and perhaps the best game for 1st to 3rd person shooters on mobile. Graphics are a noce change, with a type of cel shading like Borderlands. Controls are questionable; for precise shots, you need to be extremely steady and have low sensitivity, but close range requires a higher sensitivity. It's difficult to find a median, and as a veteran Call of Duty player the controls need to have that capability in the form of a scope/secondary joystick.Good game still. Every so often, the character won't move without me reapplying my thumb to the screen. This is fairly rare, though. Otherwise, the graphics are awesome, the controls easy, the characters are unique, there are different skins for the characters that apply different bonuses.. It's a blast. It's lasted longer on my phone than any of the other games I've played. Well done. Edit: Each match is short, which I love. I can get a few in on my breaks without having to forfeit to get back to work.. This is a great app if your device isn't compatible for Fortnite! The characters and resources are fairly easy to get, and the community is great too! I do have some suggestions for improvement. 1: maybe add a jump option to the gameplay 2: make it easier to see who is actually following you and etc. Other than that, the game is amazing! Keep up the good work!!. I am speechless, I just love it! But there's one problem. There's a bug in which I can't collect my reward like cards and chests. I have two rewards available but I can't open it!!!! I tried opening the app again but doesn't work please fix this. Overall, it has been one of the BEST shooting game I played except that there are bugs. But I will still give you five stars just bc I love it \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e. The game is amazing and I like how you create new characters but there is an overlap in the amount of ads. Every time you go to collect your reward, there will be an ad. You have four chests to unlock and you have to watch the ads before your reward and that kind of takes up time. Also, it would be nice if there were new maps added to the arena. Thank you!. Bestest shooting game I've ever played \ud83e\udd29l just love shooting games and. It is a shooting game+It is offline+ Designs of the characters are amazing \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0din this game \ud83c\udfae ,But the reason of giving two star is \ud83d\ude28 When I turn on my phone's net. It shows too \ud83e\udd2fmany ads I just hate \ud83d\ude21this and on the third day of this game, I opened it and it shows \"Frag keeps stoping\" Edit- I don't know how but the problem is solved \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4cnow Thanks \"Oh bibi\". BEST GAME EVERR! I really like the idea of the characters having different unique and awesome abilities! The graphics is amazing too! 5 stars it is! You deserve it! (Edit:) I sometimes have problems with finding opponents and when I started pressing the cancel button it wouldn't work, please fix this bug.. I really love this game and I don't wanna hate it!. I don't know what I was expecting from this game, but I absolutly adore it. First the bad: the ads. An ad plays everytime you open a chest or claim a trophy road reward. I got sick of it very quickly. Luckily, if you buy any real life money pack, the ads go away. The gameplay is very fun. Quite similar to Clash Royale in several aspects. Definitely a must play.. It was fun, Yeah, But when i opened the game today something not cool happened, I was opening chests randomly and i got Legendary Rolaf, But suddenly, The game crashed out of nowhere and automatically shut my phone down, when i opened my phone and the game, my Rolaf disappeared, It was my very first LEGENDARY and it disappeared, It's ok for me because I've been playing this game for 4 months but it's not ok for the other players, Please fix this bug right away so it won't happen on others.. It's so great, both online and offline, great graphics and also great to play with friends, of all games I've ever tried, it's one I best recommend to a friend, it's really awesome, just found a little problem with the movement control, its a bit to small sometimes when in play and shooting, maybe try to make it bigger in your next update otherwise i love everymoment i spend playing this game, it is really worth it. I love it!!! At first I'm not expecting too much when I installed this game but within a day I just can't stop playing it, and the characters are great!!! I wish the creators can see this, but can you add more game modes like King of Hill, Battle Royal etc. And more models of the map, just suggesting\ud83d\ude01. But the rest is great\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00!. One of the Best games I've played so far. Amazing gameplay, love how they designed the characters and their powers and a wide variety of characters. Game with such an amazing potential. Both online and offline play is amazing. Characters and rewards and Everything is amazing. Keep the good work up. Top Class. Addicted and Satisfied.", "neg_reviews": "Since i updated the game, it takes forever to find other players to frag against, it'll just keep searching and searching and worst of all, the cancel button doesn't work at all(minimizing and reopening doesn't work either), i always have to exit it and restart the game just to see if it'll work all over again, i thought using data might be the logic but its the same thing. Please fix this, its an amazing game and i don't want to hate it.. It was an awesome game once but right now its a trash can full of ads. This game is rotten because of ads. And curse the facebook and instagram ads if they show up there is no way to cancel them and it only goes to play store. Only way is to relogin into the game. They can show ads but this is too much. It will be better if such ads won't show up.. I'm mad. I'm literally mad!! Why the heck are there soo many ads. For what purpose I mean for the reason you wnat money, you can't annoy players like that. Literally after every match one ad is shown. After opening a crate or chest whatever.. you'll be shown an ad. I strongly say that to play this game if you have high patience and if you like this game cause there's soo many ads. Atleast for every two to three games you can show an ad and when you wanna open the crate fast you can watch a ad \ud83d\ude24. This is basically a pay to win game .People who pay for characters are much farther in league and free to play players are always watching ads. This is a good game in general but it should be equally accessible to everyone. The game is still full of bugs. Sometimes it matches with players twice as higher than your league and its annoying coz they have better cards than you.. I found this to be a really fun game and was quite addicted, but since the update (1.6.9) I noticed that I would be paired with opponents that are like 4-5 levels higher than me and that was never the case before. Also I have not been getting my Season Pass rewards that I paid for, and there's no option to claim them. Been trying to contact the devs and no kind of reply. I'm hoping that they help. Plus the offline no longer works at all, which I used a lot since my signal is pretty cheap.. Hi sir, I really liked FRAG before because I only encountered enemies the same as my level or arena, but now I can't take it anymore. I always encounter online battles with a much higher rank or level than mine. It's totally not fair at all. I think this should be fixed. This is only our problem. The ads are okay. I understand it, but this issue is big. Hope you understand my opinion.. Used to be somewhat fun. Came back to it and damn, I must've been dreaming. The controls are super clunky, but I was able to cope with it. The ads, however, I absolutely cannot. There are ads behind every single action you do, even for trivial boxes that give you the epitome of nothing. I'm not even gonna waste my time anymore. Goodbye.. Ehhh. This is a really fun game, the gameplay is solid and very unique. My only issue that other people have as well is...the ads. Oh, you want to open a box? Watch a few ads to skip the process! Finally got the box unlocked? How about 2 unskippable ads before you open it! There are also various bugs that people have been complaining about, most haven't been fixed yet. The game is a bit p2w, at some point its hard to progress without spending money on boxes. Gameplay is good, everything else \ud83d\udc4e. I really like this game but their are too many ads in it i mean it's okay if i want my reward to be double or I get an reward for watch ad but an ad play every time like when a match is over when i open a box even when after the i lose a match it ask me if i wanna change coin (which i collected in the match) to exchange with diamonds by watch an ad. If i say yes an ad play's and if i say no uhhh... They play ad anyways either way if i say yes or no an ad play so what is the point of asking.. Used to play this game a while back. Really enjoyed it but moved on to other games. Just started playing again this week, and there's soooo many ads. Like, why is there two ads just for me to open my daily chest??? As of today, these ads are just crashing the game. I've also noticed that it's been maybe a year since I first played the game, and the only thing that's changed is the increase in ads. Sure there's a few new late-game characters to unlock but that's it.. The game is a lot of fun, especially when you start to get good characters. But my god, the amount of in-app purchases there are is disgusting. Its definitely pay to win. They have a system where you can pay for a season pass, like in Clash of Clans for the whole month. HOWEVER, you have to pay for the season pass Twice to get all the rewards! Ridiculous!! Season pass then Season pass PRO. It's totally greedy. Prepare to be bombarded with forced in-app advertising.. The game is well made and fun to play, however, it has horrible match making algorithms. I will regularly get matched to opponents with a team of 5 characters that are 2-3 levels above my max player. The result is you get blown out of the water no matter how hard you try. A team of level 10s is no match to a team of 12-13s, 2 levels makes a huge difference in this game. **Edit** ok its getting worse. Just got matched to someone with a player 4 levels above me. That's a huge gap!!!. I have never seen this much BUG in my entire gamingcareer. Sometimes I can't even play, the players are not moving, they are not shooting. I gave it 2 stars because the animation. I have updated this app so many times but you could not still manage to fix the Bug. This game could be competitive with the other world big gaming industries if you managed to fix this all minor things. The new update make it no longer a fair play. You are against player higher than you. Its no longer a skill but about how much can you pay to be better. Very disapointing when you already are bombarded with ads yet they still want more. This game could be good but if your not paying this game is not for you.. Updated review, still 2 stars... amazing game however it needs improvements before it's ready for ranked play. Matchmaking has gotten better but still hit or miss. I feel like matchmaking should be based off of average card level and trophies. Biggest issue however, the glitches.... I get kicked from games seconds before winning (resulting in a loss and a loss of trophies) or more recently, not being able to move my units. Sometimes the game will glitch and you cannot move your character.. I really love this game I have been playing it for months but the thing that is bugging me is that every time and then after playing a few games the screen absolutely goes black. Im Editing my review AGAIN. I'm still having the same problems like i can't play the game anymore and my streak keeps restating.I can't play the game. It keeps happening consecutively. PLEASE Fix it.. 1 - First when I play frag it doesn't have that much glitches but nowadays glitches is increases, such as when the match start my character are not going outside the barrier they get stuck in barrier and my opponent too stuck, due to this my I have worst experience I back my games most of time 2 - Other thing is ads, It's irritating when every match ends. I know you earn from ads but you put alot of ads pls fix these 2 problems. LISTEN UP, Too Many ads! This game is good but it could use some improvements...1- Cut down the amount of ads, there's just too much of them and it gets annoying at times, 2-Improve and smoothen the gameplay, it tends to get buggy while playing...really? 3- Make it easier to get coins from matches you win, earning \u00b117 coins, then upgrade cost is 2000 coins? Come on, Even if it aint a lot, but make it reasonable. Its frustrating because this game is good but these minor issues are a problem. FIX. I completely change my mind, this games is not as fun as I remember. I know you guy trying to making money from your games but this is beyond EA, seriously I come here for having fun not for pissed by the ad, p2w, and both opponent that is way too rich and cheater. I know is shameful to be non p2w but what can you say, rupiah is 15x weaker than dollar so I can't purchase anything because is way beyond expensive in my country. You only care about money, not your fanbase.. I am gonna uninstall this Damn game.I understand the Developers need ads to earn money . But why so many , atleast you guys could regulate the ads. For each click in game I just see ads . In one hour of game time , Half the time is wasted on ads alone .

The gameplay strikes a good balance between strategic and casual, perfect for a mobile game. Plus, the PvP elements do not require energy however, which is a nice feature. They run lots of special events which keeps the game engaging.. Downloaded shortly after pre-registration notified me. Won't open past title screen. I'll adjust my review when I'm actually able to play the game. Not a good start Scopely. Seems you'd rather focus on an honestly boring anvil crush fest than a smooth global launch.... Now that I can actually get in the game, I've edited my review. Gotten past the tutorial, and it's pretty fun...so far. Hopefully the fun continues and the game remains enjoyable. The overall rating is based on rating the game for what it was supposed to be, and truly IS...a great simple fun game with cartoon childhood memories built-in. As this...this game makes me smile at a remake & repurpose of very memorable attribute from the Looney Tunes we all know and love. I do enjoy the gameplay every time. You should give it a try!. Reminded me of the cartoon! I wish it was easier to get ingredients, when you get your toons to the higher levels. I love the different perspectives of characters, for example bugs bunny has like 6 different outfits, king bugs, hair stylist bugs, original bugs, camping bugs, and boy scout bugs. Overall REALLY fun game! Would definitely recomend to anyone!!!!!!!!. Okay.... a lot more fun than I was expecting. But, growing up watching Loony Tunes and Merry Melodies, I can't tell you how much fun it is to see all the characters. And not only that, but to see each attack, and remember the exact cartoon that it was from! (Ah the memories) I will worn you though.... this game lives off of sales. Almost everything available for your characters comes with a price tag. There is free stuff though, so ya, I recommend giving the game a try. :). I really miss looney tunes dash (please bring it back), but this is a great replacement! Rubs pretty smoothly, fun for all ages, not to difficult or easy, and it brings in all of the gang! Even pepe le pew is still here! The main mode is fun, everyone's actions are reminiscent of the show, and they are funny. The main map is good, with lots of upgrades. Its not that hard to get coins, gems, characters pods, and other in game items. Overall, slow and hard at times, but a really great game!. Awesome game! Its fun and funny. Like you are in a roadrunner episode. Theres so much going on, you'll never get board. The graphics are fantastic and so real. Very fair about matching teams. Iv been playing for a few weeks now. Still events keep comming. Highly recomend this game for the whole family. Still playing the game three months later! Still awesome and loaded with new events and toon characters. Space Jam characters and xmas themed characters. Everyone will love this game! All ages.. It's a fun and exciting game. It brings back allot of old memories from when i was a kid and watched these cartoons every week day. Good 'ol Ramblin Rod, for those of you from the Portland area.There's quite a few newer characters that I'm not too familiar with. Can't wait to see what their abilities are.. Great game that doesnt limit how long you play. You dont have to pay to play, which is great, cause I'm broke. Im at level 42 and the game keeps getting better as you continue to unlock new characters and level them up. I enjoy building new teams and trying them out in battles. Every week there are several events as well as daily challenges to help unlock and upgrade your Toons. You can get everything you need without spending a dime, and you will level up fast as long as you play a lot.. Totally worth the 5 stars from me being a huge fan of the Loonie Tunes and watched it whe I was small (and would still watch it today) Also it's comical to see the characters smack each other around (from sneaking up from behind with a bat to dropping a safe from above), the graphics are SO good, collecting different types of characters and being able to power them up makes it a super fun game that's easy to get into and is even easier to understand!. EPIC. Just straight up fun. In keeping with the Looney Toons from start to finish, it's a joy every time you drop a safe or whack another toon with a mallet. Pvp is simple and fun, and resources are available for the earning (or stealing) and well worth waiting for. You absolutely do not have to pay to win, but you will invest time... Lots of it, and laugh the whole way.. I starting playing thanks to the addition of Big Chungus, but I un-ironically love this game ever since I started playing! There are many types of toons that all have roots that go back to classic cartoons that hardcore fans will immediately recognise and the animations for abilities are very entertaining! The community around the game is also very active and nice, and it is undeniable that this game was made with love! If you like Looney Tunes, RPG'S or both: Give this game a shot!. Loving this game so far. It doesn't appear glitchy and is responsive. Not even close to boring. I think it's even better than Fruit Ninja Fight, but maybe it's my love for all things Looney Tunes getting in the way? Btw, the ?'s at the bottom of this review questionnaire seem unrelated to the app.. *** Since my last review the game has come around. **** It does take effort to play the game- it's not for just spacing out and letting it run itself. You have to learn your Toons. That said, I'm now at the top levels of the game- I still have more that can be upgraded- I rarely spend any money and I find I have very little problem with bugs... the play is fine. Hubby and I are on the same team and we enjoy the game....TY *** It's on my phone but I do wish I could download to my lap top **************** Since the last update-3/20/19 the game continues to shut down. I can't even get a screenshot to show ID. I'm not getting any response from email either. I'm not all that far along (level 43 Gold 10) but I worked hard to get there. And I've Lost 2 crates -including a giant shiny one- since I can't get on to defend! Looking for a response from someone?!. Love playing with all my favorite cartoon characters I grew up with. It feels like im a kid again eating a bowl of cereal and hanging out with the gang. I play on my PC using BlueStacks and the experience is awesome, way better then playing on my phone. Bigger screen and graphics are still great. Super excited to get more toons and see what skills they have. Great job, thanks for bringing my childhood back.. Fantastic game! Beautiful graphics, lovely animations, excellent gameplay. There is a variety of tasks to accomplish and that means you can play a lot! After the latest updates, I've not experienced any bugs. For me it's one of the best games. I love playing with the toons. Even though you have to battle the whole time, there is not a hint of ugliness or violence. Everything is created in a fun, happy and entertaining mood. I love it, it's a real gem. It makes my day.. Two years of game play with no end in sight. The developers keep the game fresh and fix bugs and balance issues quickly, the character relationships and development paths are complex and strategically interesting, after all the time I have played I still am discovering new things to learn and enjoy. I frequently search Scopely for new games to play, the Star Trek game is also excellent.. This is a very fun game! There are many challenges and events to do everyday and you can learn and progress through the game with Toon Relationships and strategies in battle. With the new recent update, the Toon Squad has arrived to the game, from Space Jam Two, and will blow your mind. Try it out!. **Update 1/09/2021** The latest update has fixed the crashing issue with Samsung phones. It works great now! I love this game! Yes if you pay you can win all the time. HOWEVER, this game gives opportunity to those who don't pay to at least receive the toons over time. So far the payers vs. Non-payers are pretty even when it comes to access of all parts to the game. Strongly recommend this game!. Really good. New players can't grow anymore, if you start today, your roster will be obsolete due to a heavy scale back on rewards. Which means things WILL change. Beware tho, Scopely thinly veil how money driven they're. Sickly.", "neg_reviews": "The game was fun for a while but now they continually create new toons who are impossible to advance very far. If you don't pay a lot of money the new toons are often useless and so is the event. More of these toons are \"exclusive\" and can't be improved for a long time. The things you can do eventually become boring, repetitive, and useless. Can't play well for very long without money.. After it loads up ready to play, I only have a few seconds to do anything and then it will freeze/crashes and goes back to phone home screen. So the update made it worst than before so i dont know. Maybe some other phones are working fine but before that R&D came along i had no issues. Now its just bad. ill keep it for maybe another month and if nothing improves then ill just uninstall.. This game is always a work in progress. They change it every two days. That might actually be its worst point. I am forced to reinstall it every few weeks because of the cludgy programming. Cludgy? The purchase interface can't even tell you what you are buying. Let's start there. The world interface crashes on load consistently. Crashes so often that I have found it nearly impossible to achieve daily goals.. Surprisingly fun and with diverse group of characters. Lots of rewards and easy to earn gems. All in all a great time killer. Edit: I'm adjusting to 3 stars because my Gems have disappeared twice already in the past week. I keep losing a whole bunch while I'm trying real hard to save up. I guess that you guys should steer away from buying them!. The game's, as stated before, graphics are great - especially for looney toon fans. I have written in the past of the multiple problems with the game, due to glitches, but now customer service is unwilling to help with investigating the complaint and/or correcting the glitch and/or compensating for the error. The game has to many problems for not being in beta testing phase or within 1 year of being released to the public. It's aggravating and sad! REASON FOR NOT SPENDING ANY MONEY IN THE GAME!. It's got great graphics and character choices, easily can play without spending. Unfortunately, I have no access to the events as they start. Occasionally I'll get access before it just disappears again. Not very fun to play if you can't even take Part in the events or event quests. Please fix this IMMEDIATELY. The game is fun and I don't think the problems are refereed to \"need to play\". Instead, I think, the matter is in the variety and lots of things that the developers have create lately. Now is too complicated to understand what do each thing, between ranks, stars, cosmic stars, gadgets and more the game has become nonsense. Even more, with all of the game methods you need penty hours of game to be able to enjoy all of the diferente stages. The amount of characters has increased too much, too.. *PARENTS BEWARE* This pay to play game was fun but relatively expensive compared to other games - then they put the cost of basic energy up from 3 bucks a day to 5 bucks .. really? $1800 a year just to be able to play at a minimum level? I wrote that months ago and it keeps going from bad to worse .. making it harder to progress without spending stupid amounts.. I can get a whole lot more entertainment for my dollars. Uninstalled the money pit.. The game is fun but can get buggy. The game literally kicked me out of an event, took all my gems, and didn't give me any of the prizes i had won. So yeah it's fun until this happens. Then you contact support and obviously they don't believe you, asking you to send a screenshot. Like i take screenshots every time i play? Ridiculous.. This was my favorite mobile game, despite being a cash grab. Played daily for nearly 3 years, but Scopely has done such a horrible job at managing content, I've lost interest. Used to be willing to drop a few bucks on a small booster pack, but now it's clear that it's impossible to even have mild success without unloading the bank. Happy trails, Scopely.. The game crashes way to much! I find it very frustrating to be playing for fun and boom gone. But when there is the factor of being against another player and in a tournament and crashing?.. might be alright if I was able to continue if I log back in immediately.. NO that's a loss for me. (and my time). Been playing for over a year and a half and i still dont have a single character maxed out. The grind ia too much, and the game is oriented to pay to win, and the prices are ridiculously high for what you get in return. Too many glitches and visual bugs, energy takes forever to renew and you cant fully enjoy the events. Of course, you are encouraged to spend EUR to buy energy.. Rather than adding new heroes every week, maybe fix your app and make it easier for people to get them without EUR... Once again the greed of Scopely shows up. We all see how this game is turning into a pay to win type of game. Here it is Christmas day. A day to be generous. I was looking forward to these XMas events. So far it's extremely disappointing. I saved up 18 black tickets to spin the LEGENDARY Wheel. Well no surprise! You Scrooges changed the wheel and offered awful rewards. I only got to spin the wheel 6 times and only got 1] 100 Annubus K9 pieces. Why did developers do half the wheel as toon pieces?. Lots of bugs (no pun intended) and very monetarily based. Events do not show up half the time, there is nothing that \"support\" will do to help or compensate for the issue. If you want to actually play or have fun, you almost are forced to spend money. When maxed out in level and energy, you can only run 2 stages with free energy then wait hours to be able to play again.. Since you want to keep bugging me for a review, fine. I really like this game, but it is weighed too heavily towards pay to win. You need gems to open crates quickly, otherwise, someone with a power level that should be in a completely different league than you will steal it and you have no chance of getting it back. Like a bully stealing some kid's lunch money. Once you get to Silver League, you get less trophies for winning, but lose more for losing. It is ridiculous.. What a stupid update. Things should improve when you upgrade something, not get worst! Now, at the expense of nicer (?) graphics the gameplay is severely compromised. It was already a game that made you tap a million times for repetitive tasks. Now, even the team selection takes twice as many taps. It takes a special level of stupidity to think this is what the player wants.... You can always count on this game to give you nothing. Their new format is really only for new players to spend money, any of toon is worthless and waste, the pace is ridiculously slow now. Every odd is against you! Black hole Money pit. Obvious greed drives it. Using beloved characters to use you and your wallet stay away if you value your soul.. Game is fun, unless you get certain characters (Tweety or Queso Bandito) that skew the statistics and make winning a simple battle impossible. Animations are great. Classic cartoons are fabulous. Unfortunately, it's a pay to win game (kinda sucks that way). I spent more than 8 minutes trying to win a battle against a single character, and had to force quit the game.. I'm a long time player and all of the recent changes made to the game have caused me to think of quiting. A lot of friends have already quit and half of my alliance has practically checked out and barely participate. The most outrageous change was to the regional events a big favorite amongst the games community. You have effectively slowed our progression to almost a stand still if we don't spend loads of money. This upcoming change to war will be the deciding factor on me quitting the game.. I really like this game but it has become super difficult to level up if you don't spend actual money. This new update about the alliance wars is horrible. Why can't we use the defence teams as attack teams too, like before? This is just bullsh*t. When you claim to be a free game, you have to take into account people that actually play without spending any money. If you are trying to force to pay, people will give up on it eventually.", "pos": "Negative reviews summary:\n- Unable to open the game after downloading, indicating a poor initial experience with the game.\n- Focus on in-game purchases and the heavy reliance on sales for character upgrades, making progression difficult without spending money.\n- Some players experienced crashing issues with the game, affecting their ability to play and defend against opponents.\n- New players may struggle to progress due to recent changes that heavily favor paying players, leading to an unbalanced gameplay experience.\n- Some users have noted a lack of responsiveness from customer support when facing technical issues.", "neg": "Negative reviews summary:\n- Continual introduction of new characters that are difficult to advance without spending a lot of money, making events useless.\n- Game freezes/crashes frequently after updates, affecting gameplay experience.\n- Cludgy programming leads to consistent crashes, impacting daily goals.\n- Disappearance of in-game currency (gems) multiple times, causing frustration.\n- Increasing complexity with ranks, stars, cosmic stars, gadgets, and more, making the game confusing and time-consuming.\n- Cost of basic energy increased significantly, making the game expensive to progress.\n- Bugs and glitches, especially during events, lead to loss of progress and rewards.\n- Game heavily leans towards pay-to-win model, forcing players to spend money for success.\n- Recent changes in the", "summary": "-", "features": "-", "adjectives": "-", "search_term": "-"}, "com.tocaboca.tocastable": {"app_name": "Toca Life: Stable", "description": "Welcome to a world of horses and adventure!

One of the characters, well, you'd think he'd have legs, but, they're invisible, or, otherwise, he has none. I know you put them in in Toca Life: World, but, I wish you did it in the original. Anyways, I love the Toca Life series, and I'm a big fan of it. Keep making new locations for Toca Life: World!. This is a very very much fun game and I really love it!!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f althought there is a glitch whenever I leave for a certain time it puts Two girls, they have blue hair and they have antlers. And they pop up in my little people catolog, and whenever I go to a different place or leave the game, they disappear like if they aren't in the game and I can't find them again untill another certain amount of time. I think they should stay in the game cause I really like how they look. please fix the bug tho. \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude00 How do I start saying this-- THIS GAME IS SO AMAZING!! I have always been a fan of these games they are so cute and I can always make great stories!!\ud83d\ude00It would be great though if people could interact with others like one on one and maybe even have actual horse competitions to go to where they could compete against other players ! Other than that the game is lovely keep up your great work.\u2764\u2764\u2764. This game is absolutely great! As well as the other Toca Boca role play games, (that are free of course, as I can't pay for the games that cost). They are just incredible! So well made! I have just one complaint, not about this game but of the whole Toca Boca series, that the majority of them are not free! Such as Toca Office, Toca Vacation, Toca Hospital, ect. If you made all of them free, and perhaps added resource packs (to add new characters and accessories) which you would have to pay for , just to give that free game a bit of pasaz! The games theirselfs would get so much more downloads, and Toca Boca would become more popular as a group. That is just my opinion, and many others. Please reply. Thank you.. Ive almost bought every single game of yours! Haha! Because again, another wonderful app! It is very fun, and educational for kids. I find that this deserves 5 stars, just like the other ones. Keep up the good work. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udd92. I love the game so much but can you put a house or at least a few more animals and people. All tho I am in love with this game.. I've played these games for so long I love the stories I made the maps there are and big places I really like how can explore such big places it's great I bought all most all your games! There just super great!. It cost money but it's worth it I love it it's the best game I've ever seen or played honestly it's beautiful and you can travel the horses to different places. This game is soooooooooooooooooooo nice\ud83d\udc4d I have spent 25 bucks on it \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8I love it so much and I love pretend play games\ud83d\ude00 so one day I saw toca boca and I was like yes\ud83d\ude09\u2764.

All of your games are great and my kids love them! I bought them 4 on my daughter's tablet and 1 on my phone. But there's just on thing.why are they not free?kids have something they wanna be, see things that aren't real,or be creative and make a story or do anything they whould like!shouldn't it be free so kids can enjoy there selfs? \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Thank you\ud83d\ude0a. this is a amazing app but, when i get a notefication the sceen will freze and i will have to close it and open ti again then it will not be frozen..

It is good and I played it since I was five It has horses and stores your horse can be in a race with another horses. There's a forest. There's something cool and a surprise in the Water fontin \u263a\ud83c\udfc7.

I'm actually 11, but that won't stop me from playing this awesome game. I find it hard to find good apps that suit my taste, which is generally animals and horses, but every Toca Life game seems to fit my personality and I can spend ages playing on them! Never stop making games, they are so fun to play!. Hey there!! This game is really good. It can get kinda boring cause you guys barely update it but uhh.. I got this game from a sale and do you think we can get another sale on Toca Life Pets? That'll be great. Thanks. I LOVE IT it is so much fun and it is great for passing the time I love pretending that they are taking and making them roleplay it is one of the most fun games I have ever played so it is awesome I hope you like it as much as me. It's my faveroute game in the hole wide world because I love horses because I'm a girl it's ovius right but anyways I love this game and it's a very high qolity I would rate it a ten star If I could so I just love this game so yeah.

I bought this app for my kid, and it won't show up in Family Library, so my kid can't use it :( and it's not offering me the option to get a refund, I'm guessing because I tried opening the app to see if I could figure it out from there. Waste of my money cause i don't want my kid having access to my account or hogging my device.. I downloaded this and toca school they werent made for my Ipad and wouldnt download so i clicked refund and didnt get my money back!

I just want a refund but i can not get one i do not undersand it is the 9 top paid game but it cannot spare a few dollars just to give me my refund i would rate a -100 if I could. Can't you make other toca Boca life games free. If they aren't free in a week I will make sure that people hate this game. Some people dont have the money when we love your games I have no money and all your games Have to be paid for.I'm sorry but I would really like the games for free and not to be paid for. Like I said some people dont have the money for the games\ud83d\ude25. I returned the game after purchase and it did not refund my money.

It rated the severity of the storms/tornadoes, intensity and possibility of flooding, hail, high winds, etc., but those little icons don't show up on my new galaxy s10. In my opinion, that was the best part of this app. If I could figure out a fix, I'd give 5 stars!. Great app. Simple to use and easy to navigate through the site to find whatever you need. Information provided is usually accurate and always my go to app. for daily and extended weather forecasts. I even find myself watching their videos for way too long, next thing I know an hour has gone by, LOL! I definitely recommend this weather app. over all the others out there.. This app I've been using since before 2010. I've put it on every updated phone that I've gotten and I love it, yes love, because of the accuracy of its forecasts and especially the 10 day and the hourly forecasts. You can definitely plan ahead. Another feature that I definitely recommend, and I would hate to be without, is the radar. My children and grandchildren live in South Carolina and this app allows me to check the weather and radar especially when I'm tracking a hurricane! I reccomend it. Excellent app. This has been the best one thus far. I get real time temps, forecasts, advisories, pollen count, etc. Every place I visit, it gives me current weather conditions. And I'm okay with the ads. I also enjoy weather news and news from around the world plus when I travel I get up to the minute foecasts wherever I go. Valuable. Still loving this app. Most accurate weather reports.. I enjoy being able to see current weather temperatures along with the future forecasts since I don't always watch TV. I also like the ability to check out the weather in other areas of interest. Daily, hourly and future forecasting ... plus weather and air quality alerts, not just for my locale, but for any area I want to check, including radar mapping for all my areas of interest.. Tried other apps, this one in my opinion is the best. Intuitive, and very detailed, right down to the \"feels like\" chill factor info on any given day. Also very accurate. Quick to get info too. And the layout on home page is very useful. The yearly ad-free version makes it the best deal. Highly recommended.. Extremely convenient and accurate. It is nice to view the current temperature in the upper left of all of my devices. It is so easy to just click on my notification from The Weather Channel for the forecast and the radar.....and the weather advisories and warnings are great!! I live in tornado country!! This is very important to access this information in a few seconds!!. Easy to use. I like knowing the forecast for multiple locations. To make it even better, I would like to know forecast amount of rain or snow via a color coded picture over the map, including a zoom out view to see the big picture over a region. As it is, I check tv stations in major cities along my route and have to cobble a forecast together myself. I use this app every day.. The Weather Channel app is awesome. It's great to plan your vacation or to check on extended families weather wherever they are. Their videos from around the country and the world gives us insight on the condition if the planet in a way you don't, unless you have the Weather Channel in your TV selection. That's something Verizon deleted in the Washington DC area. So unhappy they did that. Love TWC so much, we've also got DirecTV Now just to get it!!. In my experience this app is consistently the most accurate for my daily observation of conditions in my area. Even more so than the local news stations. I'm always confident that I'm getting the best forcast for planning my week. Thank you. I love the hourly breakdown of conditions to include wind speed and precipitation amounts.. I have been using it multiple times a day. So glad I don't have to wait for 8 on the 8's anymore! You'll understand that if you're of a certain age\ud83d\ude0a. Still enjoying the app. I pay the small fee and it's definitely worth it, but not necessary to still get all the accurate info you need! 3-30-2020 Still loving it, especially without ads. Plus, now has a Covid-19 tab to check for more info. Very helpful. Still loving it and use it daily!. The Weather Channel App has provided me with the most accurate, up-to-date weather predictions, as well as accurate current conditions. I rely on accurate temperature reports to know when to open/close my windows for natural cooling. It also is very accurate at warning me of rain showers so I can avoid them when walking my dog. I highly recommend!. I like to check out my local area weather each daily so I can be prepared for the days weather and next 7 day forecast. Also when I'm traveling the Weather Channel App is a great tool to keep up on the weather in case of bad weather happens. The weather radar is really great to track bad weather movements so a person to stay put or more to a safer place. Thank you for a great app keep up the good work keeping us informed on daily weather conditions and next 7 day forecast.. I have been using this app for a short time, but so far so good. I like the ease of use and the many different features it offers. One of the things I really appreciate is being able to track rain and storms on radar. My fiance is an OTR truck driver so it really helps that we can keep an eye on any weather he might be driving into or through.. I travel a lot so I am not always familiar with the weather expectations for any particular area, so I appreciate it when I get weather alerts of the surrounding area. I also am alerted to my home area which is very comforting when I'm away. Being able to look at the forecast a couple of weeks in advance is always helpful in my planning.. Great App, you can not only see the weather in the whole world and star your favorite places, but also you can check at what time is the sunrise and sunset. Also, the pollution, how convenient is to go running, if there's any hurricane or any other natural disaster, the mosquitos rate. And not only for that day, for the next 10 days and hourly with a lot of precision. Highly recommended.. The Weather Channel App has been extremely useful. I downloaded so I could keep tabs on Hurricane Dorian, and it has been a phenomenal app. So many resources, preparation information, variety of videos to watch, multiple ways I can get the same information (videos, articles, infographics), so I can find what suits me and my needs. The downside is that the advertisements usually have a louder volume than their own produced videos, which normally will make me delete an app, otherwise phenomenal.. Very good app, lots of information. Lovely UI. More accurate than other similar apps. I'm on board with anything Winston related. My one problem is the subscription to remove the ads. I understand the business model for it, to keep providing updates and support the product needs funding and one off payments can only go so far. I'd be happier if I could buy a year (or 6/3/1 months) up front at a reduced rate. Then if I were to stop using the app for any reason, I'm not still being charged.. Honestly, it's pretty great. The location is usually pretty accurate using my GPS. The weather reporting is about as accurate as you can hope for, being predicted by meteorologists (pretty good guessers). I appreciate the warning system for floods and whatnot and the ability to customize the notifications for everything is great. Links up seamlessly with my clock app for easy access and everything.. Best weather app around! It has a lot of in-depth information, and I do use the premium version. I like the extended hourly forecast option quite useful, along with other options only available on the premium version. It's ad-free most of all! Only $9.99 for a year of no ads? Yes please! Thank you for the great weather service! I use this in conjunction with 2 other weather apps, ventusky being my favorite! I use the premium version of that as well! For a weather fanatic it's great!", "neg_reviews": "6/27/19 1 star rating when you scroll down from main page it auto scrolls down way to fast to point where you are unable to touch it and interact with it. And even when you try to scroll back up it is immediately trying to scroll back down. Used to love this app but it has started to become increasingly difficult to navigate especially after its redesign. And now it wanting to me to pay to see future broadcasts. 6/29/19 3 star rating auto scroll issue seems to have been fixed.. Forecasts not always that accurate, or in agreement with other forecasts. Was using premium to remove annoying ads, now find an even higher subscription is needed to unlock 72 hour radar. Just too expensive considering overall offer when compared to other apps. Sorry, no longer of value to me, so have cancelled my subscription and uninstalled.. I paid for the app but I still see ads. What's even worse is that it wants me to purchase the subscription again! I can the see the subscription in my play store account where I paid for. I have sent emails to the developer but they never respond. The app is terribly slow and buggy. The settings don't save, so you have to update them each time if, for example, you want it to follow your location. Please don't purchase the app or waste time too download the app. Privacy policy sucks!. Where'd the time line graphs go? This latest update replaced the VERY nice feature at the top right where you could see temps, humidity, etc on a time line and easily switch between them. Now it has a bell with notification settings, which really should be under the Settings menu. Pretty disappointed. Update: Found it on the main screen, scroll FAR DOWN to \"Today's Details\" then press the \"See Details\" button. Sad to see that this feature has been buried (compared to where it was before).. Liked this app, had it for a long time. But now there is legitimately an ad after every single video. Annoying, but whatever--its the price i pay for a free app. The final straw for me today was clicking on a video to see an update about the coming winter storm and being informed this was only for \"premium users\". I can literally get this information anywhere, but they know it's the info I actually *want* to see since it pertains to my area. So it's locked behind a pay wall. Sorry, I'm out.. This app is terrible at refreshing and loading, especially the widget that goes next to your apps. Everytime I try to hit the refresh button, the widget just goes blank and never displays the current weather. I've waited through several updates to see if the issue would be fixed, and this issue has gotten worse than it was originally. Truly disappointing, a subpar and hard to navigate application. It is also very hard to find the \"feels like\" temperature, which should be displayed more clearly.. I used to really like this app but recently the ads have gotten out of control. The ratio of ads to content is awful and they're not even good or safe ads. They're all clickbait and will probably give your phone a virus. Everything is so slow and of course the ads load before anything else. I get that you have to make money but listen to your customers. We're already bombarded by ads in every aspect of our lives, I just wanna know if I need a coat today.. I uninstalled the app briefly because I was having popup ad issues and thought this might be the culprit. I have reinstalled it and am very disappointed. What happened to the 10 day forecast option? I'm glad there are less videos and such, but if you can't see an extended forecast, might as well use a different app.. Used to be a good app. Never minded the ads too much, I know that's how they make money. Recently though, the constant \"upgrade to pro\" notifications are getting out of hand. Now when you close the app it opens another ad that can only be escaped from by clicking the little \"X\". The back button will not get you out of it. This is too far for me. Reminds me of those cheap games that only exist for ad revenue. Sorry Weather Channel but you got too greedy.. Used to be a decent weather app, now it's too heavy, filled with ads, and still lacks a interface mode. \"We redesigned The Weather Channel app to make it more scrollable\", you got that right; the moment you scroll down, it keeps scrolling until it reaches the end, you can't even get a glimpse of what the content is before it's gone, very annoying bug. The IBM branding is a shame. Uninstalled.. Used this app for many years and it has worked great. Past few weeks however, not so much. Super glitchy; radar map takes several minutes to update and show any activity. Hourly activity has lower accuracy rate compared to other weather apps. To top it off, the ads have become unbearable. Every time I click somewhere I get an ad. And no, I will not get a premium sub to take the ads off. I've uninstalled the app and am not going to look back.. I hate having to open, close, and reopen the app just to get the weather to load. The ads load the first time, everytime, btw. Add that to the radar having a 50/50 chance of showing anything but the map, and the pushy \"buy the pro version\" reminders, and you'll figure out the one star rating. Used to rely on this app. Now I have to find something new.. Used to be a great app. Whatever changes they recently did, made it horrible. Ads are bigger then the radar screen. Daily and Hourly are so different then it used to be. Alerts are hard to find, and when i did find alerts, they're on but I've gotten no alerts to bsd weather. It's not user friendly anymore. Gonna uninstall and find a better weather app.. I have always loved this app, used it for years. My phone did an update against my will, the new version is hot garbage. There are WAY too many ads for something I can get free elsewhere. the radar is awful. I played with the settings, tried to make it easier to see roads and storms but it just plain sucks. My biggest beef is having to scroll practically to the bottom of the page to see current weather, wind, dew point. That should be at the top! Please listen to your faithful users & fix!. Ugh, now you too with the loud, obnoxious ads randomly popping up and scaring me? I'm not even going to wait to see if things change, just going to switch weather apps again. Great info, always, but like you're supposed to, you ruin the app when it's doing well. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d Disruptive ads? This app has got em. Notifications don't work either, haven't for over a year, when you click on them. Avoid and try weatherbug or something else.. The actual forecasts seem to be the best, but the ads are too much now... I understand the ads tucked everywhere in between and around the actual forecasts (the app has to be paid for somehow and I'm used to digging through ads for the info I need online), but the full screen pop-up ads are too far! Deleting this app for now and honestly a little sad about it. I might try again later. Two stars for being crappy about the ad experience!. After recent updates, it has only made the free version useless and in order to actually get it to work, you'd have to purchase premium. The on-going temp/weather option no longer works, and is stuck on a single temperature and no longer follows my location. The app crashes constantly, even after multiple reinstalls. I've used this app for a long time and never had any issues until these recent updates. But people who pay for premium have no issues. Interesting.. This app will okay videos and commercials in the background. When I haven't even opened the app. They continue after I close all apps and stop after I open the App back up again (and not always). It took me forever to find the source and it's been happening at work and in meetings. Forget the never ending ads, that I can at least understand, there is something truly not right in the permissions and bugs in the app for it to be able to do this with no prompting and no notification.. This app is a joke now. Absolute trash really. Before, the app was useful, to the point, it had all the details you needed. Now, it has ads placed when you view simple forecasts and everywhere else; they claim the weather details as a \"premium\" feature in which you have to pay $60 a year to access (which is a ridiculous joke). I recommend you find the next best app that doesn't play you. And that's exactly what I'm about to do. After this review I'll uninstall and find a proper app.. Extremely ridiculous amount of malicious ads, majority of which are unskippable before 30 second videos. If you click on an article and then go back, you are hit with another popup ad. Every. Time. The latest news is locked behind the paywall if you don't have premium. It's hard to find exactly what you're looking for because everything is absolutely buried in all kinds of advertisements.

I havent encountered any fakes and the best part about it is the live streams. I really enjoyed it, met many people who I still talk and hang out with today.. nice and safety place to meet new friends. as a woman I love all the tools for help our integrity and security against the \"bad, rude and not nice guys\" you can find out in any application like this. I am so confident and comfortable to be participating in Badoo app. until i find out the right man for me...thank you Badoo Administration.! good job!. Absolutely love this app. Would be nice if older accounts were removed so I don't have to search through hundreds of them to find a match. But other than that, this app is perfect.. Love this app it is a great app to hook up. I meant plenty of women and plenty of people on here. I think there's possibilities for long-term relationships as well but as far as just meeting people it's easy to do and I love the fact that you can have private photos. I would recommend it to anyone who just got out of relationship and is looking to have some fun. One of the best software to find dates - much better than single-celled organisms adopted Tinder (where you could only press Yes or No...). And it would be even better if Devs will add a feature that will able user to write a private message to a person directly in \"Encounters\" mode.. Just a great well-functioning App, which is incredibly diverse***\"key features which are useful***\"multi-purpose platform+-live chat rooms find look-alike people function used for personal traits, celebrities or even people liked\\matched with in the past match making match making with impressive filters and Ergonomic interface. I like it, very nice apk and they made it easy to use without having to spend a dime if you don't want to. You just have to watch the advert videos and get the units to correspond. It's fabulous and the profile verifying eliminates fake people and scammers that abound other sites. Also the new video calls makes this great App incomparable. I have been using Badoo since 2013 and since l travel to so many cities and countries it's easy to make friends every where l go. Thanks guys!!!!!. every app from PlentyofFish match me so many different things and you know there's always has to look at it by this you got to buy that you can't send a message you can't get a message this string in that premium body is set up so that even if you aren't on premium you're still going to be able to use the app it's the best dating site of one of the people are fun I love encounters were you know you like you like me and then you can see the message it's a really cool app and I highly recommend. I think the app would be more successful if badoo took it another step and throughs singles mixers in area. Have a trdf5vuvubuv eam together and have events so then you can actually say that badoo is the best app for dating and social gatherings. Badoo holds concerts with well know or upcoming artist. I think that would put yall ahead of the game. Have games that you can play with another person and you can win things like dinner, movie tickets, and etc for you and the other person playing. I found this app easy to use and the prices are reasonable for the extra services. It shows local people as well as people who are further away. There is also a bump feature which shows of you have passed someone on the street (as long as your location is activated). I give this app a 5* as I have found my current partner from it so it definitely works!. Bottom line is, LOVE THIS APP! It's very useful and entertaining!! The only irritating thing is, you will tend to get replies from people outside the US. Not sure how or why, but it's definitely an algorithm issue! It depends though, it could be a good thing for some individuals bumping into someone from a different country!! But there is a downside to that, and it's maintaining a strong communication since of the language barriers, and that's when the Google Translate app comes in handy! CHEERS. Great app...it's is very good for meeting new people and also relief one of boredom .I like the way they form message and send to people whne u like them and match immediately....it's a very interesting app to use..I recommend it for all adults...the settings are easy to use...I like the way I can upload pictures and delete when I want to do so...I rate this app high..it has matured people running it...this app has helped me grow my business too by meeting new customers on a daily business.... \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0eThe Developers did a good job updating this app, i am not having anymore problems with it and am getting the best out of it. There are a couple of new features and functions within the app and I am very much enjoying those too, I will update if something changes, keep up the great work.. great I've been having the experience of a life time. I hope you have a productive time on this app as well. I've met some very feminine women and I have successful dated 3 women from this site alone. In the beginning of my wonderful journey the search was not great I will admit, but I stuck with the app and I will recommend it to any one of my friends. I hope that will experience as much fun as I have with this app. it works for me because I am a very busy man. I don't have alot of time to go o. I really like this dating app, more so due to not having to pay fees to use, but still getting enough features, plus it has a great tool that picks up certain words in convo and asks if you are ok? brilliant feature makes me feel secure. People on here seem sincere, so I would recommend it. I've used quite a few dating apps it's not really for me but this is the only one I have stuck with so far.. Badoo is my favorite dating app at the moment. It works pretty well for me! I'm a bisexual girl and I can filter out people by selecting their sexual orientation, which is super important to me. You can write a short summary of 500 characters, choose 3 topics of Q&A, tag several interests on your profile, and upload a lot of photos. In less than 2 days, I already found 5 people that seem to have similar interests and values, and I really plan to meet them in person. Thank you, Badoo! \u2764\ufe0f. Authentic and very safe. People are varied with their pictures so you are one hundred percent sure that the person you are chatting with is the one who appears in their profile. And now and then you are getting notification if you have a messages so you can't miss important potential.. The platform is smooth. It works as intended, they charge for what they decide to charge and it makes sense. Keep and eye on your subscriptions, you will need to cancel them manually. The livestreams tend to be slow, but I'm sure that's mostly due to the internet connections from some people. If not, maybe Badoo should work on that.. It's a good app, easy to work, although some people on here are not being as trustworthy as they should be on the site. I still hive it 5 stars.. This is a really decent app for seeing what is out there. I have never paid for service but the free sample part is pretty good. It would probably be awesome in the paid member mode.", "neg_reviews": "I got banned from Badoo a while back. Never got told why it happened, just one day they decided my account was done! Well, to be honest, Badoo was kind of useless at what it did. I honestly don't miss it at all. Other apps are able to do what Badoo does, with better communities, service and payment models that make sense. So, thanks for the ban. Your service is far from where it was when i joined, and its going to take a lot of work to make it better.. This app is alright I guess but gosh it's been so hard to go onto my profile to edit. When I go on there, I'm waiting, waiting and nothing. I've tried to delete my account and same again waiting, waiting nothing. I went to help centre and I did follow the instructions and yet again waiting, waiting nothing. What the hell. Seriously I just delete my account. Pretty lazy and money hungry. It doesn't really tell you how long you have to wait to get back your likes. For me it was literally 2 days and I had just gotten the app. It also has so many features that are blocked by a paywall. I do enjoy the layout but I wish the premium covered a lot more and was cheaper and that the coin system would just disappear, because I'm not continuously paying $3 for 100 coins in order to be on a spotlight or see my likes.. Terrible. Used to be able to pay by phone, not anymore, only credit card or other payments, which I don't like to use for security purposes. Prices adjusted, no notice. App opens without consent. It restores privileges without consent. You have to pay for everything on top of the premium account, it's annoying and quite dishonest. App made only to profit on top of people's loneliness and neediness, greedy and by now, useless. Your response to this review didn't address any of my points.. This app is one of many apps that use the same servers. The app \"Hot or Not\" is the exact same. I have an account on both, and they ended up syncing and I had all the same matches and messages. They use multiple apps to maximize profit by making people believe they are different. Change the name, make a new logo, boom, resell the same application to scam people. Very disappointed with this application and its developers.. Disappointing. The App was very much focused on getting you to pay. The search doesn't work well as it is based on people paying to be moved up. Before you could at least watch ads to get extras. But that seems to be going and it is becoming even more a cash grab. I didn't mind the as option as I understand that the can't operate for nothing. But seems to have gone too far now. A shame. Signed up for 1 week subscription. Got charged, but the premium features are still unavailable. I literally wasted money on this. Update: The premium features were activated 3-4 days after the purchase by itself. However they were deactivated 7 days after the purchase, like they were supposed to. That means I got to use it for 3 days only, instead of 7.. Rubbish! Yes it's free and the way that works makes sense. I actually paid for the premium account and it was still crippled, you have to constantly buy credits to do anything. You do get better quality than other free apps but they should make it clear that even if you pay for membership you still have crippled account requiring constant payment to do anything tangible. Not recommended.. What a cleverly put together app. to take your money. The initial very high number of users that engaged that I couldn't see soon turned out to be nowhere near where I lived and not matches at all when I paid for access. Would not recommend at all. Unclear whether the some of users are real at all, messaging seems to have hidden costs in the form of coins which don't go very far at all.. On the face of it, the app is well built. However, the app is poorly designed. Too many pages, the layout looks messy. Most of the girls I have found are only using this to promote there pages on I.G and Snapchat. There is a lot on TS or trans mixed in with actual females and there is no feature to remove/separate them. You have to pay every time you want to talk to one girl. It's not worth it, tinder and other apps are more user friendly.. This app is the worst--I'd give it zero stars if I could!! I regret getting a short premium subscription and now it won't let me cancel. It claims you can cancel in payment settings, but when I get into payment settings there is actually no option to do that. Be very wary of their deceptive bs--don't use it, and if you do, DON'T pay for the subscription (but then you might as well try something else because it's not worth it otherwise--you can't see who liked you, you can't mssg, etc.). I agree with alot of other peoples reviews. Not seeing if they read your message. Go premium but have to pay for credits etc etc etc! And if they like you. I believe this is unfair and trickery into making it great to pay for every little thing on top of the premium. And after the second past update. Everything is so slow. Even to sign out. I think someone has to review and make amends, or lose everyone to another app. Simple!!! Why is money being taken out of my account? I have cancelled!!!!!!!. App uses deceptive tactics to encourage payment for different areas of the app. I've been burned twice. Set your preferences to within a certain distance, oh we'll show you people beyond that distance so when you spend money to text them, it's outside of your preferences. Buy the feature to see who likes you? Oh, a lot of people outside your preference area. It just feels slimy. I've been online dating for over 20 years and am using 9 apps today. This is the worst of the lot.. This was once the best free app period for getting matches but that's unfortunately no longer the case. You were able to watch ads to generate premium currency to purchase boosts, which I felt was a fair trade off, but they removed this feature a couple of months ago. I have gone from getting 5-10 likes a day to 1 a week. In fact I forgot I even had this installed on my phone until I saw it try to update. Until they change it back to the way it used to be I won't be using it anymore.. Well, while the app looks better and more legit that tinder, it has a number of bad sides. You have to pay to play which is you have to pay to get the full version of the app which, even if you get it, can't promise to get you a partner so you can be the one to pay the money and nothing. The popularity sign is also very confusing. If you get one match, your popularity will jump from very low to very high, and if someone gets 5 matches, it will do the same. How are 5 matches same as 1?. It's really annoying that when you subscribe for Premium on this app, you consent to a daily, weekly or monthly subscription. Which means there are no one-time offers. It doesn't allow you control your subscription, you just wake up and see that you have been debited X amount. What's even worse is that you have to send a mail to cancel it. Why can't i just click to cancel,the same way i click to subscribe. *ALLOW USERS CONTROL THEIR SUBSCRIPTION PACKAGES*. Daily notifications about having to be active to get lucky, yet there is no one new to swipe through when I check. It's hard to be active when there is no one new to swipe through, or even communicate with because replies for me are just as rare. I continue to think it's a waste of time maintain a profile on this, and a waste of space on my phone. In brief, this app puts 'bad' in Badoo. First issue is that usually people do not respond to your messages and profile matches. And now the most annoying thing in the app is they show too much ads. You are swiping and there are video ads. You are browsing there are some inline ads. You are messaging there is an ad on the bottom. Recently it's an advert app with dating feature. They always show off with their number of users, but they are either inactive or does not respond to messages and matches.. This was an ok app at first and so I decided to check out the premium feature just to see what it's about. You pay around $8 dollars a week to have premium. What does premium get you? Almost nothing! With premium you get to see who added you as a favorite, see who liked you, get priority message, chat with new profiles, undo no votes, and go incognito mode. That's all you get for $7 a week and that's $28 a month. Even with premium, you still have to use credits and credits do not come with premium. I was thinking for $7/week, you should get a lot more or even credit every time you renew but nope. Do not get premium because it's not work the cost.. DO NOT sign up for the 'free trial'. The app has no method of cancelling before the end and I was charged $65 for a year of premium. I disputed the charge with my bank including screenshots from the app and was still charged. The company has disabled any premium features even though I have paid for it against my will. THEY STOLE $65 from me.

I enjoy the game very much. And I recommend it for everyone. And being able to dress up people/monsters is very interesting. This game is amazing for anyone. I sure you'll see when you get the game. And the adds are not a problem, there actually the way I got the game.. This is a great game! I love how you can make her look like a totally different ghoul! All you get to do if you don't spend any money is decorate 2 ghouls and have a a lot of options to choose from people may think that this ruins the game completely, but I still love it! Because you can earn stuff instead of buying it! Over all great game.. Great game. i love it! There aren't many ads and there are so many nice things to dress the monsters in.\ud83d\ude4c it is very creative too. you style the hair in so many ways and choose the cutest outfits. I also like that you can mix and match, that's fun. I definitely recommend this game.\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50. This game is amazing I love this game and I love the full version. I bought the full version of the app and was so happy. I loved the cheap price and everything. Please add more colors too the full version cause I need to create a character to get the colour dye and some times you don't even get the dye. Thank you so much for reading. Please respond.. This is a pretty cute Monster High doll game featuring dress up, hair styling and make up application. The available dolls selection is a little slim even in the full game, and the clothing options feel a bit repetitive, but it's enjoyable enough to waste some time playing if you like these sorts of games.. Best app! It's so much for kids. I have a 6 year old daughter, She loves to use my phone. She found this app, She used it alot! She loves to play it all the time! Sonce i found this game on my phone, I decided to rate it! Thanks so much. Creator, This is so good! I recommended this to my niece, She's 5 but still enjoys this! Best game ever!. Monster High will always be a classic, and this game is pretty fun! However, the big flaw that the devs never fixed (which is pretty unprofessional) after all this time is how the characters full bodies are not accessible when giving them a makeover. For example, when I dye Cleos hair a new color - part of her hair goes off screen and nothing you can do will bring it up so you can color the full hair. So at the end, your character has patches you couldn't reach - even on a tablet. Looks bad.. I love this game so much because you can costumize two monsters which is Lagoona and Frankie. I know that some stuff in this game used real money but I doesn't care about that. I'm still enjoying playing this game. The thing that I love the most in this game is SPOOKYGRAM. Please make more games like this because I love SPOOOKYGRAM I'd made a post that almost 1,000 likes. It is SO cool because it can inspire people to try new styles and dont be ashamed of your style because everyone has a freaky flaw! It might even help kids under age 6 to try new things! I would give this game 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 stars! I think im in \ud83d\udc9d. This game is so fun! I've been playing it starting when I was 1 or somthing around that age it is still a good game and by the way buying the monsters is not a scam but I would most likely get the everything it gives you the whole entire game and also I would say it's cheaper to buy it also gives you no adds this game is really good to trust I just wish there where more monsters that where free and they added more monsters to thank you for reading\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\ude04. That's a great game, as a Monster high fan, I'm glad that this game is available and it enables to develop our creativity. The only negative thing is that we can't play with all the characters but just with two at the beginning. I think that if all the characters were unlocked when we download this game, it would be incredibly better.. My experience on the is game is great I am 10 years old and I just got it just to get it I didn't thank I would like it because it's monster hight but as soon as tried it I fell in love with it. All the cool little things like painting nails,dressing them,doing their makeup and the cool monstergrahm and there where cool things I wasn't a where of and I'm a big fan of this app so I give it 100 stars\ud83d\ude01. Great game! I love monster high and the adds may attack but it's okay to me. I wish y'all could add your new dolls, the penny wise and grady twins. Almost my birthday and just. THIS GAME I LOVE GAME! And the monster high\u2122 theme song is also a good part of the game. Please add the new dolls and make them free in the game please! Also can we have more free ones? Thanks!. It is so creative. And you can do anything you can do the hair unlock new characters get new things and you can do a lot of stuff is just so what I'm trying to say is it's so so fun and it's good for teenagers I mean we'll probably not baby because their incidents why would it be for children I meant babies but anyway it's good for children and teenagers I really appreciate this game and I would love to play again.. I love this game. But when u give us gifts u do not unlock the locked items. Qnd most of the things are locked and to un lock them u have to pay money. And if u made an opention to follow someone 8n the game or like his picture it will be more amazing. And unlock \ud83d\udd11 some of the avatars please all of them are locked except lagoona blue and frankie stein. But if u did not the game will still be amazing. but this is just an advice and I hope u see it so everyone downloaded it.. It's a really fun and cool game. I'm a little bit older then some people who play it but I still enjoy it. I love the hair dress up and where it let's you make it and not have to pick it out.I do really love this game and I have no complaints.. This game is like so much fun you can style the Monster High people you can do their nails you can dress them you can actually the hairstyle that you made for them be yours kind of like Snapchat and you can do a lot more than that but yeah I recommend getting this because it's just really fun and I think this can be for any age really you don't need a Pacific age . And in quarantine it's just really fun to play when your bored.. This is a good game but i got forsted to only have 2 ppl to dress up for free, the rest cost monney and i dont have a lot! so the real rate i will now rate this is an 4/10 sorry that i rated it low but this game is like a scam to trick people so i rather not buying things in this scam game im gonna not play it and just. Play roblox!! Goodbye for now!!!. It's fun and all I just feel like the game needs more things to go with it but ITS A Really Fun game I All most been playing it for like 5 years And also what else the game needs is the ppl who made the game they need to unlock all the characters bc most of them are closed and u can only dress up two characters but there is still a few things to do...... I guess. I pove this game so much!!! It's so amazing can you make a version just for hair? But can you put more character options? For free? Because i really want to style other ones", "neg_reviews": "This game is bad. It is really fun at the beginning but it only unlocks 2 characters that you can design and then you have to pay to unlock the other characters. I feel like in a game like this you shouldn't really have to pay just to unlock some characters. The only reason I am giving this game 2 stars is because the graphics are quite nice and it is smooth.. This was actually a fun game there were ads but I wasn't bothered by them but then the game acted up every single time I was finished with a hairstyle or tried to take a picture of the people it always blacked out so can you please try to fix this because it is a fun game and I would like to enjoy it even though I am probably too old for this but I will be deleting it and also give us more characters for FREE. the reason why I'm giving this two stars is number one I think all of the characters should be free and you shouldn't have to pay for them number two but too many ads every five or ten minutes,and that's really it if you can please fix those two things I would be very happy to give this five stars if you don't fix it I'll change it to one star so please fix this. Its fun and creative but the main downer is that most of the things are cost money. There are only 2 characters that are unlocked out of 8 and when you go on the characters most of the hair colours, clothes, accessories ect are locked. In most games some things are locked for you to buy but in this game most of the things are locked. After a while the game gets very boring as we can only design the same two characters over and over again. Thats just my personal thought though. So yea.. I hate it you have to pay for EVERYTHING I watched a video and got something and the next time I had to pay for it They need to make serious changes in this game we that dont want to pay for this Stupid Game We Need More Characters that we dont have to pay for. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS STUPID GAME !!!\u2639\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udd63\ud83d\udd58\ud83d\udd64\ud83d\udd59. I loved it at first, but now it's the same thing over and over again. Lagoona, Frankie, Lagoona, Frankie, you get the idea, too many ads, limited supply of everything, as in so many things are locked.. This game would be great but the thing that ruins it is that 2 out of 8 are free but the rest are locked. In most games, things of high value are locked and you have to pay for them and I understand that but almost all the characters are locked and their not even of high value! Im very sad and this causes the game to get boring in a couple minutes. This is just my opinion though.. Wow. I saw my sister playing on this about a year ago. When you want to style nails? No. Ad. Unlock all characters? No. It's just doing the same stuff again. Doing the hair, nails, dress up, and send it to a fake Instagram and gets fake likes. Kind of disappointed by this app. 30 second ad. No thanks.. It's too expensive. You can only do 2 characters without wasting money. And the ads, too many.. This game is fun but it won't let me in! Okay, let me explain. So when I first downloaded this game, I did the hair and everythong, but when I tried to take the picture of her and all that, it kept loading and loading. So, getting angry, I uninstalled it. Thinking I could reinstall it and play it again. But now it keeps saying \"Just hold on! We're downloading some CLAWSOME assets from the Google Play Store!\" AND IT WON'T LEAVE!! I really wanna play this game because I love it. Please fix this.. when I started it up I finished the intro and when it opened the door is was glitched and it was frozen but the music was still playing (p.s. I downloaded this game because I have been a fan of monster high when I was younger and I am sad to report the latest is had a bad experience but I hope others don't and also it worked for my sister but not me :CCCCC. The game was kind of good to begin with, I liked the hair styling optionsbut getting it back to normal is frustrating. The thing I hate the most is that it only lets you style two characters for free. If you want more characters, too bad you have to pay for them. What I'd say overall about this game, is that it is horrible. Please do not get it, it's a waste of you or your child's time. \u270c\ufe0f. This game is very fun but I have given it only 2 stars because of many reasons: 1. You can only customize Frankie stien and Lagoona blue. 2. To unclock the other characters you have to pay real money 3. It's boring after 10 mins of playing 4. It only has certain things you can use and, the game doesn't unlock the rest of the characters later so you can only play with Frankie and Lagoona. It's good because: 1. It's time consuming 2. Creativity comes into play But, I wouldn't reccomend this game.. Game won't even open. I've cleared app data twice. Force stopped it twice. Cleared it's cache twice and even uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it WON'T WORK. Looked pretty cool but not worth my time upon downloading it.. I loveeeee this game so much but there are problems... When i have completed a makeover with lagoona blue and when i try to click photoshoot.. it's has a loading screen as usual then suddenly it kicks me out of the game and it says there is a bug.. when i try to enter the game again it has the same problem even after a month of not using it. Also we only get 2 monsters I was thinking I would get five monsters so yea I worked so hard on lagoona pls fix this. Otherwise I will have to unistall.. I really enjoy this app, but why can't I have more choices to design? I only have 2. I really do not want to spend money I'm just a kid. Can you at least add all the main characters of Monster high?. I love Monster High so much. But the game only allows you to play with two characters and you have to buy the rest. That's not fun and it would be so much better if we could use all of the characters. This is the only available monster high game now so it's the only one I'm able to play. If you gave us the rest of the characters this game would be 5 stars, perfect.. It's cute but please if you going to change the profile of the game to the original version of monster high please change the game as well I don't like the reboots as a kid I was a big fan of the original monster high but the reboot ruined it for me :(. Why do you have to pay for almost everything to even try playing this game!? Ads are every 5-10 minutes, controls are slow so it feels like ads are fly in at you every 5 seconds, and you cantbuse Hal of the stuff without paying for it! It is a great game, don't get me wrong, but c'mon! A free game should be free, not install and ask for money.. This game was so glitchy and would not work . when i tried too do the hair it kept falling infront of its face. there were also a tone of adds. I really was hoping this game would work so sad\ud83d\ude10\ud83e\udd10\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc4eI do NOT recamend this game. might try this in a year but im not sure it was a good idea bit it did not work", "pos": "Positive reviews highlight the ability to dress up and customize Monster High characters, use spooky-cool hair salon tools, create unique selfie filters, and mix and match outfits.

But it gets boring to wait for things to get done. It needs something new like events for example or shorten the cooking times. But otherwise it is lovely. Please fix the glitch it's becoming very annoying. I am stuck at race track just finished fixing it and now every time I open the game I am stuck on the race track can't move around. PLEASE FIX THE GLITCH! guys please do something about the club and race IT DOESN'T WORK! PLEASE FIX IT can't join a club or even find one.. This is the most fun and relaxing farm game I've found in the last 2 years of searching for a worthy replacement for my Farmville 2. The graphics are just adorable as are the Kittiezens and their personal stories. I hope you will continue to add more content and stories... and maybe some visiting Kitty neighbors to roam around shopping, gossiping and playing in Kitty City!. I like farming games but most fail to hold my interest. Kitty City has a different approach to farming that is unique. I would give this games 5 stars every day of the week. I highly reccommend it. kay now its months later and a warning to all because the game won't progress past level 70. and to top it off you get no reply from Jam City, It's getting pretty shxxxxy in Kitty City.. People LOVE this game. Please pick it back up & update the levels to go farther than level 70 & unlock or otherwise make new quests & characters......PLEASE. My team got so excited when we saw the sale on gems pop up, we haven't seen anything like that in a long time so we're hoping & crossing our fingers that Jam City is starting to work on it again....yes? \ud83e\udd23\u2764\u2764. Thankyou soo muhnguys for a fab easy play and relaxing New game. Have played lots of others , mainly match three but this is way better. I look foward to new quests and challenges. Well done ! X. Awesome game but I just finished level 70 and apparently level 71 hasn't been developed yet. It says 'coming soon'. Now I'm stuck in limbo. What's up with that? How much longer do I have to wait to start Level 71? I also lost points, money and items because it still allows you to submit train items but doesn't give you credit.. There is a petition Kitty City players can sign on the internet. Jam City has an obligation to every player, past and present....to give us a completed game....or at least not one left half undone. This is such an interesting game, cute graphics and relaxed gameplay, such a unique game like Kitty City deserves the attention from its creators to see it through to the City being fully restored!!. Hope the developer will see our review and pick up this game again, I think it has a lot of potential, it's a game that's worth playing .I deleted it a couple of months back after seeing review that it's abandoned.but decided to reinstall it back and try to go as far as it will bring me to.. This is how I like my farming games easy and very detailed. I love how everything is not a hassle. The list goes on and on. I love this game it really reminds me of my family and my dead cat who died in this year before her b'day, but on the other hand it's perfect I hope you make more updates soon cookie city! btw the game isn't on the website which I don't like very much. Friend me at mythic magipug if ya want to \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0a\u263a\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude00. Perfect! Some of the challenges seem impassable, but they are doable. And the amount of time you need to wait for food or other stuff to be ready is a pain sometims. Overall a pawesome game about kitties running their own little community, & then getting ready to take over the world, mwahahahaa... LOL!(No, not really, but I wouldn't care if the world was run by CATS!)Please Help my game won't load! I just uninstalled & reinstalled hope, I don't lose everything!. Great game. I love it. Currently though there is an issue with the racing game not loading for some of us. I have emailed 3 different email addresses so I will see what happens. Still a great game though. Love this game. It's relaxing and there are prizes to be won on challenges. But it's a game that you don't have to spend money on which is a bonus. I have a big problem and this is the only way i can think to address it. I'm rescuing the alpaca farmer but I never got enough gold bells to clear the area around him. Somehow the game glitched and that quest to clear the fog disappeared. Now i have completed all the quests to rescue him STILL lacking 4 bells despite doing a dozen trains along the way. The game is now stuck on the animation to free him and hangs every time i load it.. i think love it! this was the memorable game in my life! I mean it quite cute and very lifestyle so...this is the game I wanted that have better graphics, lifestyle and cute.. This is a really fun game in your spare time me and my sister play it I think it really is for everyone and I also love all the animations that all the characters do its just fun all around. This game is so cute! I love everything about it!!! I have been playing this game for hours. I do not mind waiting for how long it takes for the produce to be ready, it is that fun!!. So far I'm loving it, just hope its not like other farming/simulate your world games where once you hit a certain level its hard for you to get things you need! I'm not saying it should be easy, but it should be so hard that it takes days and weeks to earn what you need. Right now I'm having a really hard time getting or finding the gold bells. Other then that I'm enjoying the game!. One ...if the guy that create this game can do a update and get Christmas stuff in the game , that would be awesome...i love this game and when I do buy some diamonds where does my money go ????. This is waaaaaaay better than skygarden. Just one tinie little suggestion. Please make it easier to get more gems. Especially for people like me who really can't afford the full package deal. There needs to be an easier way for people like me who can't afford the full package deal. Please and thank you. Modesty Babb", "neg_reviews": "It won't even let me load the game. Keeps telling me (unable to connect to the server. Experiencing technical issues. Please try again later.) I know I have internet connection so I don't know the problem. Please fix this soon so I can play the game.. Nothing I hate than companies putting games on Google play that won't even start up. Tried ten times and after watching the loading screen for a few minutes it just kicks you out of the game. The numerous reviews detailing glitches and errors are true, don't waste your time.. Would be a good game but does not work. It freezes constantly. I have uninstalled the reinstalled still freezes. Read comments where you stated to turn off the device I'm playing on and guess what still freezes. What's next? Uninstall and not bother with it till yall are done creating it. Many other games similar to this with a heck of a lot going on also but theirs doesn't freeze. Maybe yall need to get with them to find out what's going on. Would love to play seems to be fun but not untill then. Waste of time to load just to not be able to play.. Please update your games always cannot open the game how to play..\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21. Well, it's my second review already: first one was bad. This is too. I had a problem with game turning dark and showing 3 white dots of loading stupid \"buy this pack\" first time, it only can be cured by reinstalling, as I did once already, that is when I left my first review. So... Game is cute, but problem is back and I am not going to reinstall it again. Remove this adds or fix them. Game is not playable now!. I like this game but I'm having trouble finding my last piece of wood. It's my last quest so now I'm stuck and don't know what to do. Please help!! Really like this game just fix the bugs. Controls are wonky. Requires multiple swipes to plant/harvest. Should be one smooth swipe, instead it's like playing Fruit Ninja to plant/harvest. Similar problem when building. Requires too much finess to drag building from menu bar to be built. Most of the time attempting to drag building results in scrolling through menu bar. Also has a really long loading bar. App gets stuck loading, have to force close and reopen.. Was initially going to rate a 4 or 5 but now... a 1. Jam City doesn't mind taking your money but to update the game, well... no... not gonna happen anytime soon. Been in limbo at level 71 for two months now. Anyone under level 71... take your time and enjoy it while you can. I'm completely discussed with Jam City.. A WORD OF WARNING: I contacted the devs and they referred me to another webite that maintains their \"legacy\" games (Kitty City being one of them). I contacted them and they told me they will NOT be expanding the game past Level 71 and will NOT fix any problems that might occur in the game. As for me, I will uninstall this game when I reach Level 71. Thought everyone would like to know. Such a shame isn't it?. Iam having a problem, I can't find my last piece of wood and I don't have anymore quests so iam at a stand still ,I need to know why I can't get the last piece of wood,,,, iam a patient person but this game is making me mad iam uninstalling, you need to fix all these problems in this game ,don't spend any money on this game it's a waste. HELP!! Looks like my type of game but won't even load. I've tried uninstalling & re installing but no improvement. Can the company or anyone else please advise me preferably asap. Thanx. Takes too long to complete quests. For example pancakes from cafe takes 2 and a half hours. In real life who would wait that long for food because you'd starve. Of course the other option is spend money to complete quests by purchasing gems. Gets a bit expensive but it will hurry things up. Fix it or I'm gone.. Most items are taking are taking so long to produce this is unacceptable. Please fix this ASAP. This game still has tons of bugs that should have been addressed already. It's pretty obvious that the developers don't care to listen to our complaints.. Had a glitch and was told it was fixed.. now I can't get past the loading screen. Have uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared my cache... Nothing works. game ends at a certain level from what read from reviews so I stopped playing. I refused to play such a wonderful game if it isn't going to have any continuance. I also find it bad business to take money this app if it isn't going to the development of this app. unfortunately it has been uninstalled for a few months now and I really miss playing it.. Please no more good reviews on this game as it has been abandoned for past 3 months with no update neither any support. The developer only interested in selling ads and make you utilised your data to watch videos or install new games in order to get free gems.. Fun, Great graphics, cute puns, little side stories in the quests, but it glitched on me and I CANNOT progress any farther. Not sure if this has happened with anyone else, but I emailed customer support. I got an email back, they no longer provide live support and directed me to an FAQ. That page didnt answer my question. I looked online. I tried to go to in game settings to sign out and go into a diff email but it wont let me. I cant reset game data.. This was a favorite game and I cant play!. DO NOT download this game - it is a waste of your time -, I have spent months and months playing this game but at level 71 the game stops - the makers state that they have no plans proceeding with future levels so the game can never be completed - what is the point in advertising this game when the makers stop halfway through by not adding levels so a player can complete the game ?? - SO UNFAIR - WASTE OF PLAYERS TIME - and a complete waste of mine - !!!!!!!!!. I loved this game and played it daily. However since reaching level 71 it won't move forward. After reading other people's comments I see that basically the game has been abandoned. This is not good enough and it would of been nice to be informed that you were wrapping it up. So I've now uninstalled it. One very dissatisfied customer \ud83d\ude21. After reading that the developers have abandoned this game, and that it only goes to lvl 71, I am uninstalling it!!! It would have been nice to know abandoment before I spent money! Great game to play, when you can actually play it! It takes forever to load. You try to visit neighbors and it hangs up and won't load at all.

Large numbers on the cards help me to see them better, Thank you so much. I like to play Solitare before I go to bed, it serves to relax me and takes away all the tension and stress and helps to sleep. I have been playing Solitare all my life and now I play Solitare on my phone & it tends to relax me & takes away alot of stress out of my day, then I am able to go to bed at night & rest. I can sleep because of my Solitare I played during my day.I am playing Solitare when I go to bed, .. I had this game about 3 years ago, changed phones and lost the game. Now going thru other solitaire games and finally found it. Love all the features. Able to change the background and card backs and faces. And love having my statistics board back , I like to keep track of games played and % win rate . This is a very cool game. And also love the background music it's very relaxing. Thank you so much.. I've played this game for what seems like century's. I chose your site, played it for almost 5 years. Drifted a little, but returned. It's the best site.. I lost this game about 5 months ago and have been playing, then deleting game after game, as they were just nowhere as good as this. So glad I decided to search for Solitaire Card Games and there it was. Such a pleasure to play here in bed with my tablet at night. Resting my brain helps me go to sleep. Thanks. tgc S. Ga. I have played this game for many years and I love it. I love the Vegas cumulative, the recent change where you are told there are no more moves and you can start a new game. However, once you start a new game, it continues to go thru the same scenario of having no more moves for a couple deals.. Nice trumpet \ud83c\udfba sounds at end of each game won. Like the card collection designs. Helps offered and magic wand with extra to start off with. Rewind card turns when needed. Reminder to play Solitaire Mania to play the games. Just can't wait for new creative backgrounds with other music.. Please, please, please consider an ad-free version. I don't mind some ads but they are incessant and so frustrating! Even a monthly subscription at $2.99 would be better than all of the ads that I completely understand you need for revenue. One note ~ it's not actually true that you can close out of most of them after a couple seconds (as developer stated in a previous response). I do have to say that a lot of your ads are pretty good and I've purchased some of the products!. It's fun, challenging and does not take too long to solve. I really do enjoy playing the game especially after a period of busyness. It brings back memories of playing Solitaire with my Mom and sisters - playing with actual cards many long years ago during my childhood days before Television.. This game reminds me when I use to play this game with a deck of cards in my spare time or rainy days. Playing it on my cellphone is great. This one you don't have to be on the internet and the music it calms your nerves if you make a mistakes. Also you can rearrange the cards so you could have a chance to win. GREAT, LIKE ALOT.,. Needless to say its a all time favorite. Soothing , brainteasers at times but always fun . This is one game you always should have access to at your fingertips . When you're bored even ..chill factor to indoor life-style... Solitaire, so far a pleasant experience. Excellent graphics, very helpful Hints, intriguing sound effects, automatic card collection & dispersion is swift & quite effective. At this point, since I just started, the ads are somewhat minimal & not overhearing. 5 stars.. The BEST! Calms my hectic day and gives me something to look forward to. I have to say the new card face with a graphic grungy look is probably the best card face I have ever seen. It's my style and it makes playing the game even more satisfying. Thank you for creating the perfect solitaire game. I recommend it without reservation!. Great android app. Only wish it would recognize all my logins from different devices so i keep my level of play on all devices.. I enjoy playing this game so much. This is the only solitaire game that has natural and fair algorithms compared to others that I caught cheating numerous times because of undo functions.. I've tried many solitaire apps, but this one is by far the best. I don't usually leave reviews but this game has been a great experience. I didn't know how to play when I first started but this app made it really easy. I can listen to music and the ads don't force it to turn off. There are unlimited hints and back buttons, and the amount of ads are very limited. I've never had any bug issues either, every issue I've had could be fixed by closing and re-opening the app.Great app,highly recommend.. Smooth running game without so much advertising you can't stand it- has the best options for winning hands to keep it interesting.Also doesn't wear out and get repetitive. Best solitaire I have found.. Great except I changed phones and I can't seem to figure out how to play with my old account from my other phone. So I don't have all of my levels crowns etc.... ...I use the game to calm myself...odd because at the same time I am completely on edge...then I remember to calm down....zen2me... I think it would be cool to have hats or something...I would love one. In fact I think I will knit one and wear it. I don't know how to post it for you to see, but when it is finished I will tty.. Lots of equally difficult and easy boards. Great fun! I only play this solitaire! After trying many others over the last 10 years this is by far my favorite!. This game is crazy fun! I am pretty picky about my Solitaire games, but this one beats all!!! I love it!!Try it! Its fun, pretty, challenging, yet relaxing. All that you could ask for in a time-killer. TOP-NOTCH!", "neg_reviews": "I dont mind an occasional ad, but I spend more time waiting for ads to finish than playing the game. I routinely have to sit through 5 or more ads just to start playing, and 2 or 3 ads between games. I am uninstalling this app and finding a different solitaire app to play. this one is horrible.. I used to love this game and was fine with ads in between games, but now I have to stare at a Facebook ad at the bottom of the screen the entire game??? I see your previous responses of needing ads to keep the game free, but this is just excessive. I play this game to relax, not to be constantly marketed to.. I used to really like this game; it was fun and relaxing. Now, I can't stand it. I was alright with the ads between games, but they've added a banner ad at the bottom of the screen. This takes up valuable screen real estate and is distracting/annoying. It's too much.. Too many advertisements, spoils the game! I don't like my game to be held hostage by a 15 second or more ad, plus what does whiskey (Jack Daniels) have to do with games? Deer hunter game VERY DEFENSIVE I do not enjoy seeing the ad.. Latest update ruined it. It was a fair game until this update. At one ad after each game it was a, barely, acceptable ratio. Now it's running two or more ads for every game you play. That's just more than I'm willing to put up with for solitaire. If you sit through each add you will spend more time on ads than the game itself. So now I'm deleting this and going to pick from the dozens of other versions of the same game.. WAY too many ads. Your game is constantly being interrupted by full screen ads that you have to close. I understand the need for app developers to make their money with ads, but I've never had an app that took it to this level. Either integrate small ads at the bottom of the screen or space out the full screen ads better. Perfectly good app ruined by the greed of the developers.. great play...,cant get tired of it...best yet...ads are getting longer and more in your face, a 10 second ad lasts 17, a 5 second ad last 10...ect. spending more time on ads than the game, I realize you have to make money, but where are the rewards for playing so much?. I've had this game for a few days and it's already harassing me to update it. It gives me a yes or no choice but if I choose no, the screen won't go away. This is exactly the reason I uninstalled the last classic solitaire app. I will uninstall this one now. Also, the numbers on the cards are too big, sometimes bigger is not better, it's just distracting and annoying.. Ads are way too aggressive. I understand the need for revenue, but recently I'm getting nothing but unskippable 5 second ads that interrupt Spotify playback. I was fine with ads till now, even the unskippable ads, but the interference with music is too much. Solitaire should be relaxing, and I can't relax if I have to unpause my music every thirty seconds.. I HAVE TO WAIT THROUGH LIKE SEVEN ADS JUST TO BE ABLE TO PLAY A NEW GAME, EVERYTIME I THINK IVE FINALLY CLICKED THRU THE LAST AD, ANOTHER ONE POPS UP AND THERE ISNT AN UPGRADE TO NO ADS OPTION, AND YES ALL CAPS WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE IM SO ANNOYED AT THIS STUPID AD FILLED APP ITS LITERALLY JUST SOLITAIRE, THE MOST BASIC GAME EVER, IT DOESNT REQUIRE ALL THESE STUPID ADS. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY, COME UP WITH ANOTHER GAME THAT ALLOWS IN APP PURCHASES. GET RID OF THE ADS, GET COMMON SENSE. I love the gameplay and graphics, this would be the perfect app to fidle around with when you're bored except from. Disturbingly loud and useless adverts that ruined the app for me especially that faens j\u00e6vla pokemon-ad wich is trying to rip my eardrums. Ad after ad. You click to close one ad and literally right after you are shown another one you have to click out of. Ads are fine, but maybe think about limiting them to one every couple of games. I am aware of ads and revenue for developers, but the way it's done here is unlike any game I've played before. It's so intrusive that at this point I will just find another solitaire game.. I really enjoy this app, I play on it nearly everyday and the ads have never bothered me much until recently. They've put in ads that literally force you to go into the play store, there is no other way to get out of the ad. It's super frustrating, so much so that I'm downloading a different app to get away from these types of shove it down your throat ads. Quick note, self-deleted previous review/comments. 12/04/21: What is going on w this Terms of Service acceptance before play that so many are now, just recently, requiring. Did read it, will just say goodbye, don't need complex legality for what used to be a simple offer/play. Best to everyone.. New updates play adverts with sound that you cannot silence. It features adverts that look like updates to this game. This is INTOLERABLE! This is my last action before deleting this piece of garbage. I was asked for further comment about this piece of garbage. Here it is: \"I deleted this piece of garbage because the game has become secondary to the REMARKABLY intrusive advertising between games.\". Ads glitchy and destroy game play! First thing when opening game, several ads are encountered and during game cause lagging, glitches, and game closures. Ads are understandable but when they force app closure or are unable to be closed, there's a problem. Will rate higher when this is fixed.. Ads. As soon as you decline the Unity cookie ads after every game, not one but two timed full screen ones, including ones that try and fake you to install a game update... except they can't spell. Shame as the game okay is good but ads ruin it all. There are up to 5 ads between each game and the ad takes over the audio I understand that ads need to be apart of the game, it the reason that the game is available. Often when I open the app, I get an ad, if I am resuming a game, there can be several ads. I have opened the app several times and it has taken me to get through 5 ads to start a new game. I used to play this game a lot but have gotten frustrated and only play is once a day now and if the ads a lot, I just move on to something else. Also, when the ads play, it takes over control of my audio, which is normally a podcast and doesn't restart the podcast, so I need to go back into the podcast app and restart, it's becoming not worth playing as I'm trying to play and be relaxed, instead I just get frustrated.. good app but too many ads, it's not just a pop-up anymore, you now have to wait 5 secs until you can close it. Ads pops up TWICE before you can start game. uninstalled the app and moved on to find less invasive ad free app. Takes forever to load then you have to watch an ad even before you can play!!Then you have an ad before every hand!! Goodbye I'm uninstalling this game!!Not even a 2star! I'll give it 1 \ud83c\udf1f!", "pos": "Negative reviews mainly focus on the presence of ads, the limited customization options, and issues with transferring progress between devices.

I've recommended it to all of my colleagues. My class is currently trying to outread the other classes! We have our Read-a-pillar in the hallway to show how proud we are of our reading success. I assigned individual books to each student for their Women's History project. I project the book on to the white board to model during read aloud time. There are so many ways to incorporate Epic into our day.. My 7 year old loves this app because they can read a variety if books with characters they like, cat bug, and many more. It keeps them engaged and there is a variety of things to enjoy in the app such as videos for kids on how to make experiments and crafts, sing along videos where some have the lirics that they can read and follow. Since using this app my little ones reading has improved so much and they are always wanted to read and they have so mcu fun whilst learning. Best app ever. It is a very educational app for little kids Minds, there are so much different kinds of books you can read. My three-year-old daughter loves this app and she reads books on it every day! it is a pleasure to be looking at happy kids read and learn something new! and even Scaredy Squirrel is on epic and my daughter loves reading, it so thank you for being very kind and giving kids something they love!. Really great app. When the virus spreaded through the world, I'm starting to think someone made \"Epic!\" for kids to read and have fun while some people can try to stop the virus (I think...) still. BEST READING APP EVER. Theres a BUNCH of books to read and my favorites are \"Princeless\" because it's full of Adventures and \"EPIC\" (get it, Epic?) this is such a helpful app for kids and it's like: \"The Adventures of Epic Never Stops.. It's been 3 days since our teacher gave us a subscription to Epic and while we love holding a book in our hands, this app has been amazing during this quarantine. The library is quite vast and has a wonderful variety kid books at many reading levels. We've been introduced to so many new authors and books and have found new favorites. This app is worth the subscription.. A perfect reading app. This app is the one stop shop for all the best books. I couldn't be more pleased with it. Love the 20 minute counter, book suggestions, reward badges and reading buddies. Have never had any issues or complaints. And even though my son prefers the hard copy books he doesn't complain when it's on Epic because there is soooo much to choose from. Literally a library at your fingertips. An amazing resource for any child.. Incredible way for my kids to enjoy reading and learning on the go no matter what we are doing they can read or be read to. They enjoy searching through the videos to watch something new. And most importantly I know they are safe with what they are reading/watching. They now easily read more then an hour a day. Not including listening to or reading stories while driving, brushing teeth, or while we are out and about shopping. We love the human voices and the dialogue is fun to listen too.. Next to other reading apps I have used with my kids, this one is my favorite. They have a large library for different age groups. My 3, 5 and 7 year olds can always find something They want to read. The only thing I'd add that really made my kids enjoy other reading apps would be a reward system, like pop the bubbles or balloons after you complete the book and also giving rating to the book. WHAT AN AWESOME APP!! I've been looking for a safe, audiobook like app for children & I've found this treasure! My 5 year old daughter is addicted to this app & she likes to \"read\" to her 2 year old sister every night. Right now they are stuck on the princess theme and I'm okay with that. Keep up the hard work - my children and I am very grateful.. Love it!! I am a mother and all 4 of my kids use it. It's awesome that some of 4he hooks are read to you and the words are highlighted. It helps so much with my little ones and it has other books that you can read on your own. My kids use it when we are in the car and they just go from book to book. The app is easy to use for any kid and it's just a great amount of book options for many age groups.. I have free access to the app through my job however, I ended up buying the unlimited plan due to how much my son loves it! There are a variety of books to choose from that read to him when I cannot. I appreciate the age filters since he's only 2 and can read books for his age group. Also, it keeps track of his reading time. I highly recommend this app, even if it's only a limited plan. It's worth mentioning that the limited app given through schools is only available weekdays until 4.. A little laggy sometimes, but the great selection of books and audiobooks makes up for that. The read to me feature is great for kids under 5 who don't know how to read yet. I wish there were more books for teens and preteens though (like harry potter or hunger games) so people wouldn't have to wait on a hold at the library. This is great for the quarantine.. I think epic is a great thig to have for my child because I can finally teach them a new language and they can read books that they want to read. My child loves it. Another thing is that when they read more books they get to go to a new level and they get to decorate there profile. My two children love these books my daughter found this app because she wanted to see how it was like and she loves it and my son. They were both so excited to read a book and they did it was the best.\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00. Getting Epic Unlimited set up and running was not as easy as it seemed like it would be, but Epic customer service got back to me in less than 12 hours after I reported issues. After I got the service rep the Google Play store info they need Epic Unlimited was up and running in a few hours! My son LOVES being able to read as much as he wants. I love that he is enjoying reading!!. In the words of my seven year old daughter, \"I used to be scared of reading, but then my teacher sent me Epic. Epic made reading go straight to my heart.\" She loves the read-to-me feature, the variety of books, and the educational videos. The ease and interactive nature of the app has made reading so accessible to her, and there are so many interesting fiction and non-fiction books at multiple levels. (Sometimes I find myself reading the books after the kids have gone to bed!) We love Epic!. This app is perfect for children, especially during this time when there are no books to read from the local libraries sense they're all closed. While the new pandemic is spreading around the world you can read books for free! The only problem is tthey need more books and should add books more often. Overall this app is perfect for kids.. A very cool reading app. It's much different from another reading app that's called \"Sora\". In Sora, when you search up a book, most of the options tell you to \"Place Hold\". Which means you have to wait a few days for it to be ready for you to borrow. I didn't like that, but when I saw what Epic was, it was much better. You don't have to place hold. You can just click on the book you need and read it! Hope this review was helpful. If not, there's a lot of other one's to look at.. The best feature of this app by far is the appearance of the digital books, as compared with books on Amazon Freetime, which download slowly, and are hard to read until you double click the paragraphs, which is difficult to get right with a child, etc. Even the digital books on Libby are sometimes frustrating to read. Every book, audiobook, read-to-me books, and videos play seamlessly. The selection is excellent including books in Spanish! I also love that it's free to educators.. My kids love the app. However, I don't love the customer support. I've had a ticket open since last Wednesday, with no response from the company. I hope someone will contact me because I would like to resolve the issue and continue to use the subscription. *Edit #1: I get a standardized response from Epic saying to open a ticket. I already opened a ticket! With zero response. I'm going to do a chargeback on Friday if I don't receive a response. *Edit 2: While the customer service was a little slow, they did resolve my problem to my satisfaction and have given them 5 stars.. This app is amazing. My daughter is finishing kindergarten and its perfect for helping her read. She can try on her own, the app can read it to her while magnifying the word that it's speaking or of course I can read it with her. Some books have quizzes at the end while everything gives you points towards a level and unlocking achievement badges. On a galaxy s10 or even the desktop website, it's very user friendly. After school ends I will definitely be signing up again.", "neg_reviews": "I signed up to try this in January, the kids don\u2019t use it so I have tried to cancel many times, particularly after my card is debited every month!. We are now 9 months down the track $99 worse of and still can\u2019t cancel it. The best I can find is pause for up to 3 months! If anyone who can influence this situation reads this I\u2019d appreciate some help!!! I\u2019ve found this with a few apps now where anrolling and paying is pretty much instant but when it comes to unsubscribing there is no simple obvious process. I have a degree in computer science and build websites etc so I know how to work the internet. It is almost a scam situation\u2026. I downloaded this app just to read without paying or anything. Then a membership trial pops out of nowhere. Under the pop out it says \"Have an account? log in.\" so I log in, and it pops out again I don't want to pay in advance or I don't want to add billings for something I haven't even used yet. I am very disappointed. cant cancel account been paying for 4 months now. and it wont let me log in to cancel. or unsubscribe dont download ... ..........they finaly answered me after months telling me to just unsubscribe through Google play... but my Google play doesn't show that I have an active subscription I cant log in , I cant cancel whatever you do do not download this app ! guess I'm going to have to start reporting them. Horrible. Can't login. I enter my login information and it takes me to the \"Sign up for a free trial! click here if you're already a subscriber\", so I login and it keeps looping me back to prompt me for a free trial. I'M ALREADY A PAYING SUBSCRIBER. My $7.99/month has gotten me diddly-squat. So disappointed in the experience once we started reading longer books. It doesn't save your progress, so you need to remember where you left off every time you go back to finish a book. It doesn't even remember the book you're on, so you have to save it as a favorite or search for it every time. It doesn't play in the background. We've also had a lot of sound glitches - skips, etc. Also, the read to me books are off - square does not match up with the word being read, which defeats the purpose.. Once again I am having the same problem as stated below. My daughter has been unable to access the app. I contacted customer services and I'm still waiting for a response. It's been 17 days now!!! Now onto the 9th day since I contacted customer services and I'm still waiting for them to reply to me other than by a computer generated response. I've paid for this app for around 2 years and it's becoming more likely that I will be cancelling the subscription once this month's payment has ended.. I couldn't access to my account almost for a year. When i try to enter my account, there is some one month free page appears all the time. Now, i am really sick of it. This app charges $$ every month from my bank account. I sent email to support team, but i still haven't heard nothing from them. Also, i tried to unsubscribe on playstore, but it wasn't work . So, i don't want to spend my money on this useless app. Please, fix this problem.. It's been great when it worked. However recently it was saying that I had the basic subscription even though I had an active unlimited one through Google play. I'm trying to get their customer service to recognize the problem and all I'm getting back are form letters irrelevant to what I was explaining. Eventually they just canceled my subscription which wasn't what I was asking for. I'm trying to get these people to take my money and they're ignoring me. Time to find an alternative I guess.. We turned this app off almost 8months ago but the have been charging my account every month.So I installed it again so I could try and trun it off. But it wants me to pay and sign up. It has already been paid. My child was only able to uses this app a few times before but would not let her read the books she wanted to. I have turned this app off 2 times now. And yet it keeps pulling the money out of my account. And it will not let me on the account.. I was on Epic Basic. My 5 yr old son really enjoyed reading books. His vocabulary was improving and tada, the app updated, now he could no longer read the downloaded books offline. We are not in US and It is working out very expensive to subscribe to the unlimited version. Atleast a useful educational app should be atleast affordable. I have still kept the app in the hope that things will change.. My son loved it, until March when it stopped working. Would not log in to any of our devices and received no useful assistance from \"customer service\". They just said that we don't know how to log in. As if the past three years of using the app had not happened. Could not be any more disappointed. We will be canceling the subscription immediately.. The update just made it suck. Were only able to read one book per day where as before you had the option to read as many as you like. Some were locked yes, but you were still able to read many books that were available without getting the unlimited plan. Now thanks to the update, if you don't have the unlimited plan then your down to reading 1 book per day. So this is why I say the NEW UPDATE sucks. You guys gotta fix this up. LAST YEAR I would of given you 5 stars hands down.. Can't even look at so much as a bookshelf without it taking your card. Thought i'd try this, looked like it had a good range of books. After downloading however, you can't do anything apart from start to fill out your childs profile, and choosing 'themes' they might like. After that it's a viscious circle of asking you for credit card details or sign in. If you do that, you're back at square one, filling out your kids profile \u00e0gain. Shame, but i'd like to at least look at what you got first.. I like that the book will read to my daughter who is 6yrs old, so since I've used the app I've had to Change my star review, the free version is good, there's only one problem, I cannot figure out how to delete the books from my daughters mailbox, it seems like once there in there you cannot get rid of them, please fix this problem, thanks. As a free service, I had no major complaints. One book a day was fair for a free app, the glitchy playback was also tolerable for a free app. However, it reached the point that we were told that there were no free books any longer. I intended to try the $1 month unlimited trial. After 2 days, my $1 was returned by Epic and after looking at other reviews, this appears to be a common issue. It's not clear if this is a bait and switch to get full paying members but we will be uninstalling.. I tried to subscribe for my kid. Payment went through; the next day I got an email that it was cancelled and refunded. I tried to re-subscribe, but here's the issue: the monthly option says it is 20% off with a free thirty day trial, but selecting it immediately brings up the page for immediate payment starting today at full price. At first I thought maybe the refund happened because I was supposed to get a free trial, but I don't seem able to access the trial or the discount.. it was kinda bad cause I never got to read any of the books in the app because it wouldn't let me cancel having a free month of ! !!!!!!!. Excuse me, does EA GAMES own this now!? Seventy dollars a year!? This was SO good like a few months ago when it was free. If it was just a little money, like 10 dollars for half a year membership and 20 for a year, that would be fine with me. But, even worse, some books are locked with free, basic plan! One more thing. If that wasn't enough, you can only read ONE book a day! I hope this helps people about to make the mistake of buying this. Bring back OUR epic books reading... Please.. I've been using this app for quite a while but something popped up on my screen, saying try one month free membership and I couldnt click out of it even if I tried to sign out and in. I even tried installing it again but it still pops up! I really hope this could be fixed it was really fun reading those books.. very bad because first of all this app needs you to sing in. Secondly , it's paid!! Not be an complainer but this apps is not as epic as it is in the very idiotic ad. Don't recommend", "pos": "Positive features highlighted by customers:\n1.

I think that something you could add would actually be pretty helpful. If you were to also show what the next shark that's 85% off is, that would be great. I bought nessy and the next day it was the very last shark. I couldn't afford it because I used all my gems. If you were to add that game mechanic that would be awesome. Another thing is usually whenever I swim by a big cage, it's usually having a seizure. It would just fly everywhere. This is a great game! The overall idea of it is super creative, and the gameplay is awesome! The only problems that I have is one, whenever you get near a cage with scuba divers, it like has a seizure and spins out, so if it hits you, it sends your shark all the way to below the map and you're just gonna die and cant do anything about it. Second of all, I think you shouldn't have to be level 10 to buy the next shark. The bettet the shark, the harder it is to get to level 10. Overall great game!. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! One of the best games I've ever played! I mean, sure, sometimes I was just swimming around looking for more fishies, when all of a sudden, out of nowhere, a HUGE FIREBREATHING SHARK STARTS EATING ME, but other than that it was an amazing experience!!! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would! You absolutely MUST try it!!! 100 STARS!!!. This game is really fun Beacuse you can get lots of coins from the fish and other animal in the water and get gold Rush and get to buy some new sharks and eat more better animals. But one thing I don't like is the bomb, the bomb is really annoying because when I want to go away from an animal that kills me like the fire animal the bomb already kills me so I really want the out from the game but the bomb is a challenge tho so ya. I rlly like the game do more to it!(\u25cd\u2022\u1d17\u2022\u25cd)\u2764. I had a little data issue but the staffs helped me a lot and now it's fixed!. So full stars to the agent!! I love there we'll attitude. And they will help you out even if it takes some time to solve the issue you just have to keep your hopes up. And btw the game is super awesome! Some say the old UI was good but to me the new hi is Best!!! So yeah it frikin Awesome! Yeah game and the workers behind them (Respect++)! Enjoy your time while playing it\ud83d\ude18\u2728\ud83e\udd70.. Although this game has a problem, is very interesting. It isn't very boring. I think it is better than hungry shark world. The problem is that when I try to revive my shark with 5 gems, it opens the shop (even when I have more than enough gems) and says that it is unable to connect and then the game gets stuck after I close the error message. I lose all my progress and have to restart the app.. A fun game! Love it. It 's graphics are so good, and a great timekiller! Suggestion is a holiday event where a small reward is given through how many times you've played. Although, great game :3. Easy to use and very entertaining. Edit : lowered my rating down to 3 stars because it won't let you switch your Google account or let you choose which Google account to sign in with. Signed me into my second Google account so I lost all the stuff I bought. Please fix this with an update. Edit : The support team handled this issue. I lost the data but they have fixed what they could. I love this game. Thank you! 5/5. This is a excellent game to kill time on when you are bored. There are no serious flaws or bugs. The only thing I can say is that the enemy shark invader system doesn't really make sense. You see, the system makes sure there aren't enemies that are too strong. So if you are a reef shark they wouldn't give you another player playing as luminite. However, when I play as Leo, I often see small sharks like hammerheads. That is a bit strange. They are only a hammerhead, meanwhile I'm a Leo.. It is an amazing game that I have come back I after about 6 years and it is even better. I love this game and for requests it would be too please make the game easier to move around on laptop and stuff otherwise absolutely amazing. Super. Outstanding.. Awesome game. Paying for no ads is very low, only 2$ and plus I love their idea for the evolution on the hammerhead. This makes the game fun for beginners, and plus the fact you can buy things for your shark to improve them, and you can also upgrade them. Only thing bad about this game is that gems are pretty hard to find, and items for your sharks can be expensive, as 80% of them are 200-900 gems. But overally, definitely is a game to love and to be glad to have downloaded it.. If I could rate this game more than five stars, I would. Not only is it extremely enjoyable to play (the controls are easy as well), I even was quickly able to get back a ton of past progress that I had lost, thanks to the support team, so I'm thankful for that too. Honestly can't recommend this game more (except for some mildly intrusive ads, but that's a non-issue for me for the most part), so definitely play this game!. I love this game so my much that I recommend it to everyone, that also depends on the taste that anyone has for video games. But like I was saying if anyone likes shark simulators this is the game for you. There are tons of sharks to choose from all you need to do is 2 ways, the easiest way to go without buying anything from the shop is to find the green flashing fish and that gives you the green diamonds, the second ways is buying them from the shop, which means you can use a credit card.. It's a very pogchamp app you can get gems easily by many methods and there are many contests and updates which make the game better. I am playing hungry Shark evolution after maybe 2 years and I am happy to see that the game has improved a lot. Solid 5stars from me. Keep it up Ubisoft. All the best for your games. BTW there is a bug in which if I turn of Shark invaders I cannot turn it on. Please fix the bug. The sound only goes off now once when I start the game. The motion in this game is quick and smooth. When I refreshed the game it got really fast and easier to play. Seems the sharks are updated, too. I love this game.. It is a lot of fun and you really get to experience life under the sea. There are different areas that you can explore and different sharks that you can unlock. You have to keep eating so 90% of the fish are ones that you can eat and the others try to eat you. This was a greatgame to play and i would suggest it to anyone. I adore this game and have been playing it for years but the new update has gotten on my nerves. The gameplay is still wonderful but the joystick is a little small. One thing I loved was the design, the old beach style with wood and the special sharks in a containment room. Seems like a downgrade in my opinion. I still have the old version on my I pad and comparing the new and old the old is so much more comfortable and creative design wise. adding the old style back even partially would be cool. The game got scary actually, i have been playing this game when i think it was fairly new, the game has really changed its scary, the sharks got stronger obviously, i still rate it 5 stars cause its one of the best games i have ever played, this is one amazing game, just the graphics(?), Sharks, textures etc have really changed, its not bad or anything its just new to see a big change like this, but i still love the game so much. I watched 115 ads to get sharkjira and I really appreciate that you made my fav character Godzilla thx so much by.By the way can you make 5 gems per ad it would be better and make that a ad so the much players you lost you will get all of them back\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42.... This is one of my favorite games. And for a reason. The controls are easy to use, there are little to no ads, and money is easy to earn. And with the easy earned money, the upgrades are very helpful. I 100% recommend this game to everyone!", "neg_reviews": "Used to be one of the most enjoyable games on the store , unfortunately they've changed the currency system to be a typical \"pay for progress\" game that exists everywhere. I used to be able to actually just play and earn in game currency and buy new sharks. Now you expect people to spend a significant amount of real money to unlock new chatacters? come on, typical big company ruining the gaming industry by preying off kids who just want to play games. Might as well be \"ubisoft by EA games\"!. The game itself is okay, but I hate it how it always loses my progress. Even when I have it saved up on cloud on Google Play Games. It's every time I download this game I always lose my progress. I thought that if I download Google Play Games it wouldn't reset. But it did. Can you somehow fix this? I love this game very much but I can't play it if it keeps deleting my progress.. This is an okay game, nothing special, but the in your face monetization is so annoying I can't play anymore. I had to close 3 popups for \"deals\" in under 2 minutes and I had to uninstall the game. That's absolutely ridiculous. Folks there are way better games available than this that don't waste your time trying to sell you garbage.. The evolution process is too slow. Very less gold is received per dive. Purchasing the gems and gold through real money is too pricey and worst. Why not make the paid in playstore itself like you do for your other famous franchise in steam. It will save us from continuous spending of money. Alas Ubisoft is turning greedy, I have higher expectations. Don't delete the comment like you do last time, else I will keep on writing.. AGAIN! I just lost 30+ minutes of play progress, again! Why? Because when I died, I played a video ad for a free continue, but your ad FROZE and would not stream. Is it so hard to put a CANCEL button to abort the ad, like other games do? I have lost way too much progress way too often because of your NONSENSE! Don't bother telling customers to contact support staff for your buggy game! Tell your lazy game devs to FIX THIS!. way way way way too much advertising! It's completely out of control. could have beem a fun game had it not been for that. and the game is too greedy. It takes forever to upgrade and get coins and Jewel's. Save your time and pass on this one.. There is a glitch where the asset displayed as a cage interferes with the player, causing the player to transport a vast amount into the sky or ocean. In some instances, the health and stamina display spam all over the screen causing you to die. Others have reported this too. However, Ubisoft only responds with \"please go to our website\". I am unsatisfied once again with the glitch in the game. It has been happening for months at this point and they won't listen.. Not a good game at all. As soon as I get 5 minutes in, things I can't kill start coming in and trying to kill me. I avoided them, but 7 minutes later some gigantic mutant shark like creature comes in and eats me and I'm completely unable to stop it. This isn't truly free to play, it's PAY2WIN. I need cash in order to get a large enough shark.. full 60-90 second ads that you cant skip. they also dont give you the option to pay to remove ads. its a fun game but that pretty much ruins it.. I played this game a few years back, had every shark unlocked up to the colorful purple looking one which was at the time the highest shark and I had a bunch of customizations unlocked, returned and downloaded it on a new phone today using my same Google account but there was no data saved and it shows that I have nothing unlocked, it would have been nice to unlock the new sharks they had released since then but I won't be restarting to unlock everything I already had so I'm uninstalling.. Love this game a lot. But recently I'm facing a lot of bugs and glitches. 1) The kraken mission \"Sharkdiana Jones\" where you have to kill 8 other krakens using \"Whips of Chaos\" doesn't work at all...even after killing more than 10 krakens...the progress is 0%. 2) Cages are creating a mess. 80% of the underwater cages are full of glitches. These keep on moving rapidly in a circle...throwing away my shark...sometimes resulting in a total glitch...and have to quit the game. Please fix these issues.. this is my favorite game but lately I've been facing some really stressful situations with it. I've installed and installed the app more than 5 time already, did everything I could but I'm convinced it's the game. Everytime I streak very high points it simply stops. the game keeps counting time, everything moving very normal but I can't take any actions and lost all my progress everytime. i invest too much time and money in this game to be facing this. please, do something. I'm begging.. please help me with something.it keep saying \"unable to save,sorry but we're not going to be able sto save your progress.and it even said check if i plenty of space, i have 2 gb free space in my phone but keep repeating please help.. It's good that you're adding new sharks, but I wish you didn't add game-breaking bugs with them as well. Every time the Kraken and the Luminite run out of health, they don't die, but just float to the bottom. The game does not end and there is no revive prompt. The only way is to force quit and lose all your progress. This bug has been there for months, ever since the Kraken was added. Fix this already!. You pay for stuff to get boosts, you pay for the big bad shark and when it comes to actually playing and make a run of 20-30 minutes, the game freezes at the end and looses all your progress. If I could get a refund for what I spent kn the game, I would. I used to like this game but stopped playing back in 2013 as it was freezing. Guess what... 2020 and it is still freezing and loosing progress.. will give game 5 stars once im able to access the map i purchased. Spent 2000 coins for a map, the map icon is nowhere to be found and i emailed support about the issue. As of yet they have not replied back to the issue.. First, the quality of the graphic is far simpler than Hungry Dragon. And then, the control is so bad. It is not easy to navigate the sharks. Sometimes the sharks do not react to eat, even when they are closer to the preys. The gold rush period is too damn short, .In conclusion i suggest you to improve by making Hungry Dragon is a reference. I enjoy the game but have multiple issues that I can't get addressed because (edit cuz Ubi can't read. 1 star now) *THE SUPPORT LINK IS USELESS*. My progress in each sharks missions doesn't save like it used to. Say I have to kill 5 Alan's with Moby. I kill 3 in one game and when it ends. Gone. Useless effort. Another is the cages. They start swinging like crazy and knock you around the map. Finally, multiple times I've had the game glitch and deplete any progress made during those plays.. Would've given a 5 star rating because I love the game and have put a lot of time and money into it. What I didn't realize is as your growth points get higher and higher, the health meter depletes faster and faster. I was at around 65 million when it became impossible to stay alive. Now I feel like I've wasted my time and yes I have the all the sharks. Doesn't make a difference. Really wish you gives would fix that it's upsetting to the gamer.. Yes, I have contacted the support for these problems. I would rate this higher if not for all of the bugs. Dive cages and lag will break the game.", "pos": "Negative reviews summary:\n\n1.

I really love the versatile gameplay. But I hope that some of the mob and boss bug gets fixed. Because sometimes when I'm fighting the just teleport to another place. Sometimes the server disconnects me, and when I log in, it says the world is full even when it's not. But overall it's a great game and addicting to me since it has a versatile gameplay.. For now, I'll leave a full star review as I have yet to encounter a problem -- What I can gather from the game is that most, if not all things can be gathered with grinding, which is the bar I set to want to play a game before game mechanics or visuals. Speaking of mechanics, they're simple MMORPG ones but they do their job. And the visuals are cute and impressive for mobile gaming, a rare sight.. Very great rpg. No auto quest. No auto path. You move your char by yourself. Good graphics. You can costumize char hair, face, eyes. Many colors and hair styles. Great avatars. You can use all kinds of weapons. You can change colors of weapons. You can build your own stats/skills. No need to spend real money to get strong. Of all the RPG games, this is worth to spend times for. I Love This Game \ud83d\udcaf\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4d. Great game but not beginner-friendly. You'll have to do some research before really begin everything, but once you do, you know almost everything. When they said 'complete freedom', they really mean it. You have a total freedom to do anything. I like the story system which gave you rewards after completing a part. But my phone's update destroys a part of it -- as if the game had been zoomed in -- tho it wasn't a big problem.. I've been playing five years now and it still never ceases to amaze. I love some of the interactions I have on the servers and my guild is always the best to me. If you're looking for a game with active guilds or interesting players, The controls and interface are easily navigated, although the targeting system occasionally gets in the way and you may open your inventory in the middle of a boss fight. \ud83d\ude02. Amazing game! Graphics is great yet not buggy. I love how there is freedom on how a player can build a character. It is also good that they don't push in-game purchases, you won't need it to level or get good items. One can do a lot here, especially with their regular updates and seasonal events. This is something I can see myself play for years.. First time playing this game, it's so awesome. I love the graphics and everything. I thought it wouldn't be smooth, but I was wrong. It was definitely smooth and has a friendly user interface. What I would suggest, add some beautiful scenery plus different relaxing sounds. Day and Night cycle so we could really feel that the world we're stepping is revolving. Places where we can find what life we really wants, since that's what the game is. More features to come, we will be waiting.. Been playing this game for almost 2 years and no other mmorpg games made me last this long. I really loved toram. Whenever I took a break from it, I keep coming back. Even though it has many bugs, I still love to play it. As long as the bug doesn't interrupt me while I'm playing there's no problem with that. Keep up the good work and hopefully more events and collabs to come. Happy 6th Anniversary RPG Toram Online.. It's fun, I've been playing since 2020. You'll get bored but there's a lot of things to try and keep you busy. I hope it can add a voice chat probably since mingling with friends is one of the things we do to kill time in there.. I've been playing Toram for almost a year now, and I have to say, the updates are just getting better and better! The game is still lacking some things, which are highly optional but one of things I would like to be changed is the amount of space the game takes? Heheh, it takes up like up to .GB amount of storage on my cheap phone so yeaaaahhhhh. But, as I said before, it is highly optional.. Absolutely LOVE this game. The world is not only massive, but beautiful too! Thousands of players in the game and it's just amazing seeing them all there. Me and someone from my guild went traveling around most the world and i had such a good time. There are lovely forests, waterfalls, sea shores, flower fields, and cliffs. The freedom in this game is just everything I've ever wanted in a game. It reminds me of the anime Sword Art Online but different. The story is also really fun \ud83d\ude0a. Amazing game with equally great graphics! Never seen anything like it before! I would prefer it if going to certain maps wasn't locked behind finishing the main quest, because the main quest gets a little tedious at times. Also, could farming for materials for the blacksmith or synthesist be added in quest format? I find it easy to forget the amount and location of the materials required. Overall, this is the best mobile game I've ever played. :). I haven't gotten TOO into it so far, but from the hour or so I have played it has been EXTREMELY fun and captivating. The story and characters are nice, and I really like how level and skill management is handled. Reminds me a bit of dark souls due to the stat names and how they function similar, which is a nice touch. So far, 10/10! Lovely little game!. Don't care what anyone else out there says- This is the best mobile MMO right now. I tried searching for more, but Toram just felt the most at home of them all. It's relatively simple, but large enough for everyone to explore new places and new things. There is so much to it between combo building, crafting, and customization of your character.. As a longtime gamer, I have played my share of games. Very few can call themselves \"great.\" This one can officially be considered great (in my opinion). Toram has a great mix of dungeon crawling, crafting gear/items, and freedom in building your character(s) how you want. There is a learning curve if you haven't played a game like Monster Hunter or Harvest Moon. The combat system is flexible to your style. A must play for MMORPG fans.. I'm really hooked to this game for over 8 years, you have complete freedom to do anything in the game, banger bgm, extremely detailed and active, I'll edit my review every year, I'll see you next year. Heh. \ud83c\udf03. Amazing graphics and I like the range of choices available when designing your character. Nothing is confusing. And people tired of auto stuff, this is the game for you! Nothing is auto! No bugs yet, loading is pretty smooth, no freezing. Only thing is there's the regular currency and there are orbs, and I wish orbs were easier to get without paying real money. But this is a great game.. Toram is a really fun game! In the beginning it was rather complicated, but after a while I got used to it. Most of the players are really friendly, and the storyline is great\u2764 Though Toram requires certain amount of WiFi and storage capacity, it is totally worth it. It also drains quite some battery amount but its fine. It took a while for it to load on my phone, probably around half an hour? I really recommend this game, but also make sure that your device is a supported one. Keep it up\u2764. Great game. You can create the appearance of your own character based on your preferences and move the character as you want whenever and where ever. The events every month are also to look forward too. The avatars are also both cool & cute. (The only downside FOR ME is that the orbs are too pricey when you can't buy the specific avatar you want.) I wish that you could purchase the specific avatar (either top, bottom or accessory) that you like.. \ud83d\udd38 This game is the best MMORPG that I have ever played! but please make the reset stats and skills for free. Buying a reset skill and stats is so expensive for us. I've been playing this for 3 years with a lot of different accounts because every time I mess up my skills and stats I can't fix it anymore... There are a lot of things we want to try besides our old character build but we just can't because the reset is so expensive for us.", "neg_reviews": "re editing my comment due to two reasons one I cannot open the app. it says unknown cause, cannot connect to server please contact us for more detail. so I m guessing either the app has defected or there is an unannounced maintenance either of which tips me off.. if there is a maintainance you should update on site or let players with registered account know by mail.... so if u want me to reconsider my 5 star feedback to 1 star after this u better improve first. Months of non stop gaming went to waste... I should have been rewarded with much more, considering the fact that I didn't know my progress was lost, so I wasted the orbs... And I leveled up my characters really high, stopped playing and came back to this... From lvl 160 down to lvl 71, and I get 200 orbs that were wasted on dumb stuff, thinking everything was alright. Bye Toram, it's such a shame, I was a really top fan, and I really really liked this game a lot... :(. Gears and weapon gets outdated easily. No point in farming n grinding. Waste of time. Only good for hanging out with people. Consider this another game like vr chat.. The UI is over complicated and the dialogue has extremely poor vocabulary. You can't dodge so no matter how far away you are from an enemy, it will still hit you and you can't cancel skills either (which take an absurdly long time to cast) and the boss battles are usually at least 10 levels above you even if you are above the required quest level.I took a level 27 quest that put me up against a level 50 boss. Not worth it.. I've been playing this last 5 years ago and unfortunately the device not supported anymore so i'd stop playing it. Good thing that I've sign up before it. Now I'm back again, got a new phone, and for some reason I can't login. My phone model is Samsung Galaxy A01. Please have to make it supported to this phone cause I really wanted to play this. I dont want to start over again :(. can't connect to server, and i don't know whether my connection can't reach the server, or the server is currently in maintenance. please fix it so know what the cause of this error. edit: new update is up, then i cant login due of full server. i am never play this game, but already disappointed by this. edit2:i think i wait long enough. look like this game is not for me.. Its really frustrating to keep getting connection failure.Its a question how is this yet to be solved for such a long time? Everytime i tried logging in, it just pop up \"Unknown Error\" Fail to connect to the server, please contact us for details. Please do something about it.I hope i could get a pleasant answer from it instead of just avoiding the topic.. Toram sekarang sangat berat dijalankan, permintaan speck sangat tinggi, RIP pensiun main. Its a great game, but it takes forever to load, Idk if thats on my part. I was able to get on twice and find a less crowded server, but after that, when I logged on, it wouldnt load. EDIT: Okay so I was able to get it up and play. I've been playing for a couple months, and it's great, BUT just recently(since the update) it hasn't been loading at all. The same thing is happening to my sis as well(who plays with me) it's been 2 weeks, and we still can't log in!!. The game was okay at first, but for a week now I've been having reconnection problem. Reconnects every minute. I can't play well. And I've read I'm not the only one who is having trouble with it recently. My internet connection works fine with other games so it's not an isp problem. There must have been something wrong with the server. Kindly acknowledge. Hope dev team would fix the issue.. 5 stars at first few years of playing but it gets boring. None of the devs and gms seem to bat an eye on bots. It's ruining the game. Do you guys even know how far the gap between the richest player and a first time player is? It's astronomical. The events are repetitive. It isn't exciting anymore once you get everything you want. It's become boring, generic and mundane.. too grindy, even making a begginer equipment is a chore. for example, a Wolf Armor needs 20 skins and 3 horns, i've beaten the wolf countless times but can only collect 1 horn and 2 skins. and the market price is ridiculous, 1000 spina for a common material, you don't know how hard it is just to collect 1000 spina, let alone wasting it for a single common material. i think i'm done with this game, i don't feel i have to waste any more of my time.. The development of this game is turtle slow. Old players are bored and have nothing interesting to do. The events are old. Developers only created 1 new quest that only last about 5 minutes.. This game is 6 years old so the developers does not really mess with it much anymore. The developers focuses on eternal which is a direct copy of other games and you can only play it if you live in Japan. And if you do manage to play it, it will be full auto and language in Japanese... Banned random for all player, RIP GAME. Now beware as this is an honest review as I have played this game for over two three years now and finally deleted it. While this game is completely set on a whole other tier of other rpg games I have played, it is still terrible espically if your a newb when your playing in blind. The difficulty scales waay to fast in the story and the best way to grow stronger is unless you put money (atleast $10+ if you really want to become better) the grind is way to harsh and the chat system is so stupid. I've played this for about a month and all I can say is its a good RPG game with a good story, soundtrack, graphics and more to offer. The only problem is, this is not player friendly. If you intend to play just for fun then do so, because buying good equipments cost such an absurd amount of spina and so much time grinding. Honestly the drop rates is low af that you'll have to gemrun in order to get some items and gems costs a hefty price. So just wait for an event to craft some good equipments.. Just started and can already tell it's gonna be a great adventure. EDIT: Ok went from 5 stars to 3 because it was fun, translations could be a bit better but nothing to complain about. But now nor me or my girlfriend can get on the game. idk why it just refuses to connect no matter what we try. EDIT 2: Soooo I got back on, but everything I've done on here was deleted. 2 stars :c. OK I love this game I've been playing it for about 3 weeks now, but I can't open it anymore for some reason it's stuck on the start screen is says error - 1 or something like that, I've already tried everything from restarting my phone to reinstalling the game, such a shame that all my grinding will go to waste, I do hope they fix this issue in the future because this Is just stupid.. Mkay yeah, I have a problem with this game... What is up with the leveling??? It doesn't make sense, the monsters and bosses levels are not matching the characters. It just makes the game harder, sure challenges are nice but it takes way to long. Plus the pricing SUCKS, I feel like I'm paying WAYY too much for things. Honestly, I feel like I'm wasting money as I play.... Apparantly there are requirements for what devices you can play it on. It does work for mine altho barely. I dont know why there are requirements, but there definately shouldent be. It is so laggy that just walking is a struggle. The game itself is pretty good, but the fact that my device isnt good enough (even though its brand new) just takes so much away from it. Hopefully this will be fixed in the next update.", "pos": "Negative reviews focus on occasional mob and boss bugs causing teleportation, server disconnections, and world full errors.

I want to keep learning more to understand the application properly as a result of it's easy usefulness in opening or operating some other apps. Moreover, because of my experience in playing with the app, it became more excited hence I used it as my default browser. I still want to explore it the more to get a better understanding.. It's simply the best. If u need a fast, reliable and authentic browser, check out phoenix browser. I did doubted its accuracy and efficiency but after downloading it and usage, it became my best and my default browser. The best part is that one can watch videos easily without having to download or log into YouTube to view it. It brings YouTube to you at your comfort. \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f. I simply love all you do, keep it up.. At least Your team has responded, to let me know whether you're trying or I'm wrong in my opinion, many don't. Only last problem is that when I am in incognito tab, if a new site pops out it automatically switches to the main tab. And of course it doesn't happen with chrome or any other browser. Yet thanks for your reply.\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17 And yes, I use this browser much more than chrome.\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d. It's a great browser. I love to play video on browser and this app really suitable for me. Have a good video control and even download option. It will give better experience if it has these features: 1. When I open link in new tab/background and then press the back button, it will bring me the home page instead of closing the tab and navigate me to the previous tab. 2. Give an option to play video on phoenix's default video player. 3. Optimize video thumbnail.. A greatly awesome browser; superbly fast unlike some others. Even when my network has low signal, it opens up sites and when the signal is strong, it moves in an unprecedented speed. It detects and block annoying ads that drain my data. Wow, this app is pretty awesome and cool! I was surprised the first day I used it; it was as though a rocket was moving.. This is the browser I jump to when I click on a video link and have an advert shoved in my face. I also appreciate the one click save page to pdf. Bookmarks are a breeze and you can go back And forth between pages without that one click too far, that cyber point of no return. There's a very searchable history too, just in case. And downloaded files too. Ironic that what led me to this was wanting a browser that makes downloads possible and easy. My default browser. No rival.. Best browser for Android as far as I'm concerned. I've only one issue with the latest update..The instant exit button isn't there anymore..One has to go back to the home page just to exit.. kindly look into this issue. Thanks.. Phoenix is my go to app to download videos until recently. There is no longer a floating download prompt button to tap. Neither can I find a download prompt anywhere near the search bar as suggested in your response to a similar complaint. This is frustrating! Please fix.\u2639 Thanks for quick response to downloading complaint. Problem solved after latest app update. Good job!. I love this app because it is si fast in browsing,searching if app,saving status,giving notification about politics and and other it give public anouncement about everything that is going on life it save all apps in phone it work with goggle it gives opportunity to get money it let people who don't know how to open their bank accounts to open it easily on this app and learned it and it so fast for searching bank app i prefer this app than any these is my experience in this app good bye love it. Hi I'm a user of this awesome browser and thanks very much for the great app. If you can please help out with this small issue after the latest update that will be great. My problem is that I cannot select the quality of the videos which i want to download like before. Now it's only one fixed file size and it doesn't show the quality of that video either and before it was clearly gave us an option to select the video quality as to 240p - 480p - 720p etc. If you guys can get that fixed, Magic \ud83d\ude4f. Lightweight strong browser; really like it! I've used it for 5 weeks now, with complete satisfaction. A really useful, good app! Thanks to the efforts of developers, I continue to enjoy the marvellous browsing experience with Phoenix..! The updated browser keeps getting better, with scores of helpful services.. Though the ad blocker is less effective on free music sites, it still helps a lot in peaceful browsing and quick downloads. Keep it up!. This is app is absolutely perfect, it's all in one. Easy navigation and it saves you time of having to scroll out and go to another app, as it offers various things such as status downloader, it plays your music, it has also options to other apps websites, no need to type them. Thanks to the developers of this app, let's hope they will come up with a device version\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05. I'm not quite sure what happened since my last post but either it needs to take some time or be honest I'm not real sure \ud83e\udd14but whatever\ud83d\ude0c has been done to make it work again. But I'm \ud83d\ude01very happy that my app is finally acting like it used to Act again. So I wanted to say thanks to the dev's for taking timeout to email me so you can figure out maybe how to fixing my issue. And every time that I've had issues. Y'all took the time to do that. So thanks a bunch for doing that.\ud83d\ude0a. It's done great to me by enabling me identify junk files and clean them in optimal time. I get news briefs in umpteenth time. It helps in checking the temperature of the phone and optimizes it. Whenever the phone goes slow it's given a boost. It helps in identifying the very right time to update my system. The app is very easy to use because it's automatic in identifying defaults and pointing them out by itself without me looking for them , it gives solutions to the same. The app is very clear. this app is really amazing it downloads exactly what ever you want from any site on the web so fast that you might not even notice. and it has links to every music, movie, anime, cartoon etc downloading site, and basically updated about literally anything, anywhere, any lifestyle etc. if you don't download Phoenix browser then I don't know what you are waiting for.. For eight years I have been installing and uninstalling different apps, I was the best at finding the best apps you could need for everything, two years ago I came across Phoenix and underrated it saying I couldn't have it on my phone, not until this week when I gave it a shot, turns out it was the best app I should have used from the beginning, phoenix is everything, it is all apps in one, if you haven't downloaded it yet, I suggest you do now, you won't regret it and you'll thank me I know..

However, it didn't stop nagging me with nonsense, like wanting a 5-star rating, becoming the default browser, and need to access notifications. This is an excellent example of how a promising app is wrecked by making it too intrusive.. Astonishly buggy. I tested 30 browsers past year. Phoenix can download photos and videos from FB, one of only a few browsers that could. But for the rest: not a smooth scrolling process after a while, buggy, and an absurd large bar at bottom taking up real estate. The extra abilities like built-in phone cleaner is very intrusive. Spyware perhaps? Switching tabs can be improved further. Annoying 'make us your default browser' and 'rate us' pop ups. Downgrading you to 1 star.. The forced ads on phone screen. Lowers the rating. Honestly thinking of searching for another app. Just installed and thinking it was a no. Immediately ads come up. This was a huge mistake. Deleting. Too many other apps that won't disturb. I respect that ads means income. But inside an app. Enforced ads. Nope. The screen displaying ads. Pass thank you. 3 ads within 5 minutes. Enforced. \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude21. Excluding the inability to disable notifications despite the instructions, now the browser doesn't even load since the recent update. Open, crash, open, crash. I've sent in 50 crash reports. When is something going to get done and corrected?. The developer has ruined this browser by allowing ads to show randomly while your browsing. The ads plays for 5 seconds and you cannot skip them. The ads pop up evry few minutes and are extremely annoying. I loved this browser but have to find something else because the pop-ups ruin the browsing experience.. This was the best browser I've used. Until it got updated (an update I didn't even knew was available after reading some comments and saw that it happened weeks ago). It must have gotten updated when my device shut downed. This annoying update doesn't have that download bubble, it keeps going portrait mode every time I go to home AND when I try to switch over to other tabs. It was better before the upd These things are making me reconsider to never use this again cause it's annoying too much.. Everything used to be perfect when it comes to Phoenix browser until it stopped loading plug-ins for document reading when I factory reset my phone and updated the browser to the latest version. Also, there's no option for 'download plugins'. As it stands, I can't read any text document in any format on Phoenix Browser. The last thing I want to do is to disable this browser because it's one of my all time best. How can you help me?. This is the good apps I've used, keep up the good work with blocking all the ads. well this is before i gave the feedback and now this app is giving me a headache and stressing me out real good, i forced myself taking a medicine for my head, the cause of the problem is when i want to download the movie the ads its only detect and can be download not the movie itself, pls fix this.. I have been using this app for quite sometime now,but recently it developed this problem of crashing eat time I open the app, A message pops on the screen that says \"This service Is not available at the moment and the saver will quit it 3 seconds,after the count down,it will automatically cThis, Please I need this to be fixed because am use to the app and it very easy for me to use. I love this app with all my heart, but the lewd adverts of shameless men and women displaying their privacies are directly against me. I tried to dismiss many of them but their type still show up more and more. And the most annoying is those that can't be dismissed. It's your business but I feel that there are other kind of ads to show which will not pollute people's mind on your platform. I have just disabled the app to see if there'll be a fix. Thanks for the good work. This is a OK app for what its purpose is. To download music videos etc. But pass that, as a browser. IT IS HORRIBLE. The bookmarks are clunky, with the 2 step process to save. Also the fact that folders cannot be made. My biggest thing with this app and most like it is, that it doesn't have a passcode to get in and the fact that it doesn't work on all websites. Now the VIDEOS WON'T DOWNLOAD & THE BOOKMARKS ARE FULL!!!! USELESS. I give you just one star cause this app is just so not good. It does have good features like the status and junk cleanup. But the problem have outweighed the benefits. The dark mode ruins the look of some sites. This app totally allows fake news. If not that this is a system app, I woulda uninstalled it a long time ago.. This used to be a good app, but the last few updates have been getting worse and worse. Changing incognito to a separate tab instead of a mode is a fail. The latest update looks terrible and childish. It does not rotate to landscape, staying in portrait no matter which way the tablet or phone is turned. Major fail. Quickly losing its appeal.. I like this app so much that I had to set it as my default browser. But sometimes I will seriously trying to search for something and it will be like \"error loading page try again sometime\" The whole day you will search search aah and the page will not load. So try fixed that for us.. If you simply want a web browser, consider other apps. This browser is wuite good at blocking ads, but it's jank, somewhat unintuitive layout choices and the sheer pushiness just do not make it worth it for me. No, I don't wsnt privilege. No, I do not want to rate you 5 stars. Will you please stop getting into my face about it?. It's light and fast......great. However, the news content is irrelevant, inappropriate, fake and is not to my liking. Even when I do delete certain news items, they reappear . It would be best if they were not there . I don't know if this concern of mine will be taken seriously or not. That's up to you developers. Note that if such issues are not delt with, you are likely to loose users despite all your hard work.. I knew I should have not done the update! The previous version was 10x better and much simpler to use. Was using this browser to view and download videos and now with this new update they want your location for \"weather\" and have your WhatsApp file right there it's a real shame I upgraded. Total regret. Does anyone know how to go back to previous version of the app?. They have again worsen the browser by displaying inappropriate ads while downloading videos. It becomes a lot of time consuming while downloading multiple files. Please remove that page that comes after starting download of any video. It seems that user satisfaction doesn't matter to them. It is a very bad idea to display inappropriate ads and making money. One most thing: it says it has a powerful ads blocker. What about the ads it gives by self. Phoenix is no more 'Phoenix'. It's a great app overall. I would rate it five stars if it opens links on new tabs. I don't know if it's my ignorance or the app is designed like that. Whenever i search on google , and long press a page to open in new tab . It does not show open in new tab or open in background etc. All it displays is copy link and block ads etc.please help . It's annoying.. Too many Ad on this app and the most annoying is that when browsing or downloading you will just be move to a different tab with nonsense information not related to what you are doing and it happens every few seconds that means you will have to spend more time in something which should have take you less time. And finally some when browsing with this app your play store will just open with and Ad to download an app that you don't need am sick and tired of all this you people should fix it", "pos": "Users appreciate Phoenix Browser for its fast browsing speed, data-saving capabilities, ad-blocking feature, and the ability to download videos easily from various websites.

I also love that you do not have to constantly pay for everything little thing. You can pay for different types of life games but that is your choice and you only pay one time. It's not like other where you pay for the game, then pay stupid coins to keep playing, then pay for certain items in the game. This is the one game I've found that not greedy and is a pay one small amount. How all games should be. Very Entertaining but one thing, when adding the total, it says 1310k or 2000k, instead of 1.3m or 2m. It threw me off at first since I was earning money but allowed me to figure it out in the long run. Maybe it was just me lol! Very fun though, this is my second time playing this game ever and loved it since. If Life was this simple, I think we'd all be millionaires. On a serious note, one of my favorites of all time. Timeless and underrated game! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. This game is to fun for me I don't think it should be for money though but it an amazing game sometimes said what to spend with money if your that person you can spend money on houses and at the start you can go to carrier or pay college for 100000 personally I would pick college because you get a better job for more money. Just like the board game, however, much more fun! There are a few different game boards to choose from, (in-app purchase), there is a choice of different colored game pieces, too! The graphics are stupendous, and it's comical, as well! A HUGE THANK YOU to the developers! You've done an Excellent job!. I got this for my 6 year old grandson to hopefully teach him that life throws all sorts of good and bad at us yet we can still win. I love the old style 1960 version of the board game and played it endlessly with my siblings when I was a kid. This electronic version is very close to the original with the added bonus that you never miss an opportunity because your bratty brother would spin before you could collect your salary or beat you up instead of give you money :-) I love this game. This is great! I love playing this game, so when there is no one at home who wants to just get on this!!! It is worth the money 100%! I recommend for everyone! The only downside is that you have to wait for players to join and sometimes they leave or do something during the game which makes everyone have to wait... Other than that AMAZING!. I love this game! It never crashes on me, it lags a little when you're playing online but that's expected, and as for someone's problem with the black screen, I believe you just need to turn your screens auto shut off up in your display settings, I had a similar problem at first and did that and it hasn't shut off again while in a game, my only suggestion would to make a save opinion for our cars and gender? Otherwise I'm completely satisfied, worth the price! and it's fun love the animation!. this really brings back memories. It has a few twists to the original game such as a single player mini game, and risk road. Note that there are several themes, not required, that can be purchased single or as a bundle. I might buy the extras. I am not sure if I have seen all the cards but did not see any disaster cards like \"your house got damaged\" (might be my imagination it has been a while. good game.. Its a great game and really fun and has a few mini games in the actual game which is really fun (wish there were more *wink*) the only problem I have is when playing online there aren't very many people so it's hard to find a real online opponent but I feel that's due to the fact you actually have to pay for the game but other then that it's all really great.. Awesome game! The only thing I wish is that we could unlock new boards with their careers as we play because it was hard to pay for the game itself which I've never done until now. I can't afford to buy all the boards and after many games it is getting a tiny bit repetitive. Other than that one issue this is my favorite game on my tablet. Oh I almost forgot that in the description it says we can get google achievements but have not seen an option in the actual game.. My experience was excellent! Although the kicking out part and being disconnected all the time can be and is very annoying. Can you please work on a update for that, that would be very appreciated and if you can a way for it to stay logged into your Facebook so you dont have to log in every single time ... Other then that I give it a strong 5 stars!. It's like a new twist on the classic. You can play with other players and when you land on certain spots, it creates an animation scene that you couldn't get playing with the physical board. There are also little side games to earn more game money. For those who love playing the physical board game will love this.. its really fun, and it is really cool that you can play against your friends, or a cpu! this game is awesome! there is practically nothing wrong with it at all! the only two things i would change is maybe let us edit the computer cpus, and maybe less in game purchases. that about it! :). It's a great game and I purchased the season pass for it but since I got a new phone, I haven't been able to restore my purchases for some reason which feels like a waste of money. So be mindful. Edit: The developers were quick to respond and guide me to fix my issues. 5 stars. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a. It's really a classic good game. The only problem that I have is that game froze on me once today and quit out. so I had to start it up again and press continue. If the game fixes the issue. It'll be a fab game to play for any ages. Please update the game so its stable to play.. I really love this game especially since they added more different background to play on it but I think it would be really great if you would add different cards. Make new cards so they can match the different types of background boards you guys have. I think it would give it a whole new experience and maybe if you guys can also add the midlife crisis in here too I think that would be even more awesome! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude02. Was unable to restore a previous purchase, the app trying to charge me twice for the same purchase, and finding no option to restore purchases. However after receiving a response from Marmelade (Thank you.), I tried again, and this time it worked. With my purchase restored (and not billed twice, I am happy to say) I re-rated. I do have a lot of fun with this game, and I have no problem giving 5 stars.. Love it!, has the feel of the original but with a nice splash of smoothly animated cut scenes. Great for playing off-line, my son and I have been really enjoying it. Will purchase some other skin options soon. Worth the small cost to purchase.. Fun game but when trying to buy a new pack it shows an incorrect amount of money in my Google play account balance which wont allow me to use my google play money to buy it. 3 stars until that is fixed, then I'd give it a 5. EDIT: Issue was fixed, clearing google play cache and restarting my phone fixed it, thanks to the developers recommendation. Happy with this game overall.. Love the game of life its been my favorite since i was young. I paid for this game, so i feel like all the modes should come with it, i would understand if the app was free but it is not.. And they are all like 3.99 a peice!! Thats more than i even paid for the app.. If your gonna charge atleast make them cheaper than the game is priced it self also i would of really enjoyed being able to name my characters.", "neg_reviews": "You don't get much with your purchase. You get the game yes, but if you want additional themes or pieces, you have to buy each one individually. No bundles whatsoever. This game should've been free with better priced in app purchase. No Hasbro, I'm not going to spend an additional 5 dollars for a motorcycle helmet. The prices of everything are awful. Hasbro replied with the \"just cosmetic\" excuse so I'm dropping another star. You did not add skins as a Choice; you did it because you're greedy.. After you buy the game, you have to buy each individual map or pay $20 for a season pass. I paid for this game once, I'm definitely not going to continue to pour money in it. For less than $20 I could go buy the actual board game! This game randomly crashes as well, very unstable. I do not reccomend :EDIT: They replied and said the in-app purchases are cosmetic only which is a huge lie. Since when is a new map considered cosmetic? Cosmetic is a new avatar or new vehicle design, not a whole map.. I originally thought people were exaggerating the technical issues here. They 100% were not kidding about how often the game crashes causing you to get kicked out of your game. Come on now, this isn't a free app, get the support team to figure out what's wrong with the game and fix it. At a certain point it's just scummy to get money from people for a non functioning app.. I don't understand how an app called an charge so much to buy, then turn around and try to sell upgrade options on the very basic version you get. What did I even pay for then!? The few cutaway scenes are generic and get old quick, with no option to skip. The touch response lags bad though that you will feel like you're going to tap a we hole right through your phone after banging so hard out of frustration.. So upset I spent $4 on this game. Should be for free with all the glitches. I have entered a game and tried to play 3 times. The game keeps kicking me out and it glitches. I was half way through a game and I got kicked out and session shut down. When I went back I lost my position, I had to start a new game & this has happened 3 times now. Not very stable and very disappointing. Graphics are amazing but you need to fix the games. Not worth buying it, I'd rather the board game right now.. Not great. I loved this game and you've done a good job porting it to android except for one glaring flaw, it crashes constantly. I have a new S10 Plus and this game cant run for more than a few minutes. Instead of deleting this review like my last one, maybe work on bringing more stability to your app. The game is good, just like it is on the board game, it just needs more polishing to be worth spending money on, as it is right now, this game is unplayable and I regret spending $3 on it.. I just installed this game today I've tried to play 7 games in full mode with multiple players. I got knocked offline in three of them, the game froze in two of them, one of the players froze so the game became inactive, and I had one successful completion. The game was designed very true to the original board game and I love that about it. It's a shame that I paid money for something that keeps crashing. If it would stop crashing and freezing it would be addicting.. Good game but keeps crashing.. This game could be fun but I do not know. It has crashed 6 times just in the first local game. This should have nothing to do with service so why is this game I paid for crashing all the time when free ones work just fine. I already know I will not receive a refund but if ever one was needed its here.. I love this game in real life, and at first this version was good. But then we realised that the player who starts last wins the game and 90% and the mini-games. So now it's boring because we know the outcome from the first spin. I noticed that other reviewers commenting that they didn't think the spinner was random. This definitely seems to be an issue with other users and since Google won't give us a refund, I just hope the developers can fix this.. The game constantly crashes. You can't play online with other people Cuz half way through the game, the app closes. At least the game saves when you play the computer, but it still closes. This is a paid for game that isn't really worth it. Especially since I considered paying the extra 20 bucks to get the other boards, but not if I can't play online, or finish a game without it closing.. I had to switch phones and when I tried to play I keep getting a message saying download unsuccessful. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it three times and it still won't work. It was a good game before but now I can't play. It's been over two weeks and it's still it won't work I've un and re installed countless times and nothing. Please do something or refund my money. It's been months and it still hasn't worked.. i just downloaded this game, less then 48hrs ago. it has been refusing to open for almost half that time. i have updated it, restarted my phone a few times and nothing... realy messed up that i cant play a game I PAYED FOR!. Crashes. Love the game of life in real life,, However when they decide to let the AI when it is blatant cheating and no one likes to lose when being cheated! I mean come on Hasbro at least make it fair. It's like the computer decides who is going to win at the beginning of the game and then it's just obvious through the whole game you might as well not even play if its not.. Unfortunately I would like to rate this higher, but I have NEVER been able to finish a game. Every time my friends and I play online multiplayer it crashes on one of our phones. If I can't play, I'm not rating it high. I've tried cleaning my cache and uninstalling and reinstalling, and no luck! It is still dropping us, or crashing. Ugh!. GLITCHY AS HECK!!! Not worth the $$. The graphics and game play are truly amazing and I really want to give this 5 stars...but I just can't. The option to play with friends is ridiculously laggy and if you click off the game or get a phone call or something, you get booted from the room and cannot re-enter. I wanted to play this for a virtual game night, and we all paid $3.00 to play, and after 3 games of at least 1 of us getting kicked out midway through, we decided to call it quits.. This isn't Life. It looks like it, but they've changed the game substantially and not for the better. Further, the game is slow, with many unskippable animations. the people who made this don't know what made Life popular, nor do they know what a good video game feels like. And let's not mention the terrible attempt at microtransactions.... DO NOT BUY! Fun but buggy, i have to login to facebook each time i open the app. If i switch a screen the connection to the multiplayer game is lost. Multiplayer is very instable in general. EDIT: once the update as mentioned comes I will update my review accordingly. Edit: update is here but they made it worse. Facebook asks for a loging each time that you open the app, autofill doesnt work. The screen just reloads. DO NOT BUY!. Currently it's not upto the mark I thought it would be for paying for this game. The game is crashing constantly after every second game. Furthermore, there should be an option to be able to check ur stats if not for other players, meaning I should be able to open up details of my player during game play to see what house/houses I have and how many kids do I have. I'm playing on OnePlus 7.

Its honestly one of the greatest apps to edit in but i just hope that you can add a feature that you can change the aspect ratio of the video mid-editing because I just find it so tedious especially when you've finished editing a video, and you change ur mind to make it have a different aspect ratio, it's just so hard to open another file to edit again. I hope the team gets to read this review.. It's a good app. Best Editing App ever!!!. It helps me to edit my videos and it has a lot of options and materials to use.. You just need to explore those materials and tools. I am very happy to CapCut. It is a good app. To the person who made this Wonderful app. A very big \u2764\ufe0f heart and appreciation for you. Thank you so much... \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc95.. I love Capcut so much. I use it for all of my Amv, Gmv and other edits as well. Capcut is very easy to use yet so hard to master because there are so many Combo animations that you can mix together. But here are some updates I'm expecting from this great app. \u2022Add a Motion blur option for overlays, just like how you put graphs. \u2022Please make the text effects on the effects tab Changable. \u2022Add more stock photos and videos such as overlays and plain colored backgrounds. Anyways luv yall\ud83e\udd70. I really love this app very efficient and the templates and effects are very good too. Please stay as a free app with no ads. I just want to add for the layers tab I wish there's a lock option to layers so it won't move whenever the clip is deleted or changed. That's all for now i don't rate apps but this one is an exception.. there are a lot of reasons why i love this app. 1. it is free 2. no watermark 3. barely any ads (or at least from my experience) 4. there are a lot of options to choose from. i really recommend this app for beginners like me and i hope this app will always be as good as it is now <3. An easy app to use. I'm not a professional video editor but when I edit some pictures or only add any music to an original video, it seems like a professional video editor made this! I like this app very much! Though I like this app, I feel like it needs to be improved like as it needs more tools. I'm sometimes bored to use a tool again and again. So I'll be very glad if you have added more amazing and unique tools in this app. I like to edit. Anyway, thanks!. Very easy and great video editor. I do want to comment on a couple things. First, I like how that if you end up closing the app, the video will still process (as long as you don't force quit the app). I closed my app accidentally once but found the video on my phone a few hours later. Also, this app doesn't take m4a audio files; they won't show up. Kinda stupid you have to convert a m4a to mp3 or something just to be able to use that audio file; that's probably my only criticism about this app.. Iam usig this app like 5 months this aap is awesome but there are some things that you should fix like you know the transition... Like look at the adobe the transition is awesome can you make this kind of transition it will be a big help and the slowmotion is not good.. slowmo is not good enough to use make it smooth slowmo in next update but i hardly request please try to give us some transition like so much good for making transition videos soo ya thankyou..!!!.

I wanted to share my experience by using this app\ud83d\ude42 So yah, I really love this app .....I used a lot of other video editing Apps, they r also good bt the other had some problem ....Every single editing Apps has premium features which I hate it but this app doesn't and so I am in love with this app....I have a request.............

I love this app so much, but please help: sometimes when I edit a video, I leave the app to do something else. Then when I came back to continue editing, some of my pics/videos are gone and it says \"the video/pictures has been removed, please check your system album\" when in fact, all of the media are still there in my gallery. It is such a hassle to go and add it again & sometimes I forgot which media I put in my video. I hope you can fix this. Thanks.. Absolutely love this I use it everyday. I would like to see one change, when I am cutting up different videos to put them all together I have to upload each clip into my photos to be able to edit them together. I would like to be able to cut clips save them in my Capcut folder and then add them together without the extra step of uploading them to an entirely different area. Besides that I love your App.. Really a nice app,,,,best for video editing on smart phone,,,,,best quality effects,filters,enimations,adjust system,,,,,Overall I like this application so much.. This is the best video editor I've ever used so far not gonna lie. I haven't encountered any bugs yet. There is also no default watermark, which is just great. The only problem I have on this video editor is that it doesn't have an audio visualizer effect. Please add it as soon possible, I just really need it.. Really it's awesome every time to edit my videos when I m bored I start using this app in my leisure time but its my routine now yesterday was my daughters birthday I make a video on capcut all guests were asking how you edit video from which app I just tell them now they are editing better than me so of course \ud83d\ude43 it's very useful app that I have ever used but it stuck a little bit \ud83d\ude42 never mind love from capcut to me is unlimited ........................................................ This app is so GOOD!! I can edit nicely, but sometimes it's logging but I rate this 5 stars because this is so good, and you can post your own template. I love this!! The tempplate of the vid is so so good because its like real life.", "neg_reviews": "I used to use the app to edit until recently. The effects and fonts and transitions won't load at all. I tried reinstalling it back to back. I even switched phones. So I thought it was because of my storage so I deleted almost everything off my phone and it still didn't work. So I asked my friend to download it on his phone to figure out if it was my phone or the app. When he downloaded it, the same thing happened with him. Pls fix this all I wanna do is edit.. I use this app because it was very smooth no lag but now it's so laggy to the fact some pictures will appear faster or slower than what I set it to. The text won't even show up now, So I just exported images of text for a short video like 20 secs of just a recording. I finished exporting and the text didn't even show up nor the music which is from the app itself.. I loved this app. It was easy to use, had a lot of transitions, and filters. The things you could do with this app were limitless. Well, that was before the update, or something. The app had difficulty with videos around a minute long or less, when before i could do 5 to 7 minute videos with minimal lag. It's annoying. Preview won't work at all. I've tried uninstalling, clearing cache, etc. It still won't work. Please fix this, I love this app really much. I would love to edit videos again.. Used to be very good app, have a lot of cool features and also free which is insanely amazing. But lately, everyone said its bugging, like really bugging and it happen to me too which make me feel disappointed. The creator also didn't do anything or reply the feedbacks. Just hope the bug would get fix. Way too comfortable with this app to change to other apps.. When i click the video It just takes me to the end of the- video and it dosen't let me scale the the video. Please fix this , And lots of glitches keep occuring. ( Sorry i'm bad at explaining ). This app is a headache. After update everything is gone wrong. I edited my vlog in this app for a long time after finish my edit when i go for exporting my vedio the app crash everytime. And also huge storage the app fill up without download edited vedio. Literally painful app. Just fed up.. I have been using this app for about 2 year. I had no complain. But after the last update when I go to import a video it keeps compressing the video and it's so frustrating to wait 5 min for a 2min clip to import. Before I have added a whole movie in just one click, no compressing, no waiting. Feels like this app isn't going forward but backwards.. This apps works perfectly before but not now. Now, every time i am editing the clips lag all the time and sometimes the clips don't work at all and they glitch like crazy. Until, you fix this, i'm putting it at 1 star.. It's really buggy and when u slice a video then play it lags and after a few secs it plays with speed. It's really dang annoying and this is the only one I can make vids easily with. Please fix this and also. I was once making an edit with overlays. I used the chroma thing to make something rainbow. But before doing it I tried to play the project and it was laggy and kept showing the capcut end screen when I sliced it. It's really stressful and annoying. I literally tried to export my video many times but it disappears in the half way. I used to enjoy using it so much but now it won't even export big files. So frustrating. I've been editing this video for a week. I couldn't upload my video because it won't export fully and moreover it doesn't even export fully But eats up my storage for no reason \ud83d\ude20 fix this problem as soon as possible \ud83d\ude20. Full of bugs, sure it's free but that's no excuse for the amount of bugs I've encountered while using this app, such as the video freezing at a certain point, making it impossible to finish the editing so you have to scrap the entire thing, there has been many good ideas for videos I've had to scrap because of these bugs. It's good for a free app but bugs need to be fixed.. whenever i use auto velocity, it always go back to the home page and leaving the video as it was before. it only consumes data. please fix this. you deserve a one star because i get frustrated as i have tried it to work for so many times.. Overall a great app, but recently (I edit YouTube videos with it) I cannot add in audios, they just do not appear once I add them. It's weird because it never used to do that. It just happened one day. I even deleted and reinstalled the app (which erased all of my WIPs) and there was no change. It's a shame too because it's so good, but now it just doesn't work the same as it used to.. This app is very good for edition... But the problem I'm facing nowadays is I have to wait so long for editing like...If I increase the speed or do slowmo or trim some parts or anything like this...then instantly I can't play the video I have to wait so long which is very irritating. Great app, just one problem. Whenever I start to make the image duration smaller the thing just bugs out and makes it 30 MINUTES LONG! Super frustrating! I've tried EVERYTHING to get it to stop. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, closing the app, deleting the project, etc. But NOTHING WORKS! PLEASE fix this. I would honestly be so happy if it gets fixed because capcut is an amazing app and I don't wanna stop using it. So please just fix this problem and ill be sure to reinstall and give 5 stars!. This editing app is very good, recommended for beginners.. but there's only one thing I hate in CapCut. 1. Automatic cinematic bars. Frankly I don't like cinematic bars at all. This is so annoying because everytime I export a video, this will happen. I am very used to it since the problem has appeared at first, but on second thoughts it still annoys me. 2. A problem with the mic section. Sometimes, CapCut won't record my voice even though I am sticking my nose to the phone. Please fix this.. I used to love this app. So many editing options, smooth and easy to use, no watermark, what else could you look for in an editing app? But recently it hasn't been great. I've been experiencing horrid lag, the transitions and video affects wouldn't apply properly, the video would jump and jitter a lot, etc. Please fix this. I want to be able to love this app again. The reason why I gave 2 stars because if I try to tap the play button it doesn't work I'm surprised I used this app from the start and now it's not working. Don't get me wrong, this app is really good, but the thing that really bothers me is that, when i add effects/transitions or just split a video into more videos, it starts lagging very badly. The effects won't show, the screen freezes and i can't work with that at all. At first I thought the problem could be my phone, but that's not it... It'd be amazing if there would be a way to fix this or at least an explanation.. The overall quality performance of the app gradually deteriorated since the other features came. I have this really nasty problem about moving/hovering overlays, audios, texts, and effects, where it just teleports to somewhere instead of just staying place in the area I want it to be. I've tried resetting my phone and install/uninstalling the application just to somehow fix the problem, but nothing seems to work anymore.

Yeah this game is kinda fun a lot of ads but it's still fun And same to the ather games that they make so be greetful That you have this game because before it was with \ud83d\udcb0 Soo yeah sooo I don't know what to say about it now By manner. Amazing but why you need to pay of the last rooms can you make them free or app to unlock ;(. Even though we need to pay for it, I still like it. For people to pay, the game is really good. I heard that it's only \u00a33 for 7 rooms. This is very fun, just pay for it. Everyone's fussing about the money, when it's literally \u00a33! Design is cute, love the characters and style of it. I like the game itself, and for the people who are fussing about the money when it's only \u00a33, stop fussing and just buy it. It's not even that much. I love this, even if I didn't pay. I'm saying, just pay for it!. I'm 9 years old and I like this game This game is so easy and fun. i love it like u can make your own stories amd it the BEST game EVER and i dont care that u have to pay it still the best. It wont even download before today it downloadid fine but now none of ur game download its super weird i would give all of ur games a five star but they just wont download pleaseeeee fix it \ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude36:-(. This is a really good game but just because todlers play the game maybe put the whole game free so they can interact with all the features!. game is good but I really wish all the rooms unlocked because that's not that's so annoying I hate it game but I just don't like how like some a lot that's so annoying I got a vacation one and you can't even go on any of the fication you have to stay at the hotel and all the rooms are locked but one that's so annoying so cool so please fix this game. It is good but I dont like that you have to buy 4 of the areas in the game. But the rest is great you can play and move the characters and food and toys. I liked the game but I really wanted more rooms in every game without paying. Amazing 5 stars! I unlocked all rooms Withe the play pass! Thankyou thankyou thankyou! I wish you could make a play pass for urban city too. But overall best game ever!. Best app for young kid..my son love all your app game specially hotel. It got so many options in there.

I wanna say plz fix it. Ok thanks. If you guys fix it I will give 5 stars thanks again . :). I first downloaded this game and I was like all this game is going to be so fun even though I'm a little old to play it but when I first got it and everything was almost locked like I didn't like that so right away deleted it cuz I just wanted to give them to bed and then like I know right it was locked everything was locked and by 7 years old so I'm not that will to play it but for me I can't buy these things so yeah I I hope that this yeah that's all I got to say for right now bye. Ok so I love love love your games. My only prob is that in all the games you have created, most of it is locked and it is the same with this one. Not cool. And Patrick Antwi, I tried going to download lucky patcher, and there was no such thing on play store. Please identify the name of the app and say it correctly for all the people out there and me. Thanks.. I like all your games but do you really have to lock all the rooms like seriously I can just blow my money on unlocking rooms is there a way you can like change it and put a few more characters in all the games if there is any way of changing it pls change it. I like this game but there was three doors only it should have all the doors or a time limit. That's why I have given it 1 star.. All your games make no sense you're going to have to pay for a children's game like why would a child all the games I don't want to pay for it it's going to put I know you're growing up in business but it's like it's just fraud because you just want people's money for their social two-player game makes no sense you just want money that's what I'll do your games like this pigs you're all greedy\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\udd25 and I'm a child. Ok, i download this game and i saw it saw it wil make kids happy but FALSE like i cant effort this game and you have to pay money for it and plus your making the kids baggin there mom or dad for money just for a game like just for a game i had enough of those nonsense payin, people just want to have fun playing your games how are we supposed to love your game and we only have to place to play in i will gave this a one star people that say that they like they stupid because they stealing ur mony. The fact that people bought it and it uninstall it by themself and when u reinstall it ask you to buy it again if there is a zero start optionni would have picked it kids love to play it but u make them difficult buy asking them to pay just bc other games ask you to pay doesnt mean u must follow them and why cant u add a watch an add to get about 10 or 15 minutes to play for free like pepi. This game is tooo good but it is fully of money and i not waste money in games please make free or give ads to unlock. I only gave this two stars I was downloading it for my cousin but then she comes crying and say I can't pay with money for it I mean I'm only a kid and I can't just ask my parents because they would say no who makes a toddler game and makes you have to pay money and it's on your other games like the heck if you would fix this I would give you a fire but since you're not I'm giving you this much so you going to have to fix it or do I have to deal with bad reviews. Worst. I buy the full version of this game. But i cannot use this game in multiple devices. And the worst part. Unfortunately the games was remove/uninstall in my phone. When i re-install it again. Its not the full version anymore.MEANS I NEED TO PAY AGAIN TO PLAY THE FULL VERSION. WHAT THE ****** I EMAIL THEM BUT NO ACTIONS TAKEN.. It was pritty cute definitely could tell it was for toddlers.

Just please don't be such a greedy person. I have one question..Why do all of us have to buy every thing that's good? And get the meh stuff? Like I'm OK with that.. Not rlly but ok. Ty and plz help. Its so boring you have to pay nearly every room for 2.00 something its not good its not my thing but yea its for babys you should just work hard on it a toddler could not play the game they might press 2.00 buck thingy is not good good luck ok. Its ok but there is only 3 things you can play for free and then with all the other rooms you have to pay. This is ridiculous you need to make all your games FREE!!!!!\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21. I hate it because it is like you will have to pay it only has 3 rooms that's not fair but when you think is fun it gets boring so fix the game and make it all free. I hated it when you tried to feed the kids like if you gave them soup or a drink they woudent take it i even tryed whith the spoon and the fork it still didt work its a wast of time and this is sinades phone not carols. Please make your games actually free I do love them but dont have the money to buy please I'll watch ads for each room! It's It's great game will do 5 stars if you do so.

Very important for writing. Apps should be updated by adding some important features, such as- (1). A4 size margin for working on the page. (2). Introduce centimeters, inches and pixels. (3). please add some format category. (4). Make an arrangement to create a PDF file. So that the work created can be printed on A4 paper. Apart from these, the other features are very nice. Thanks. Please fix the problem and update. Please....... Please... Please..... Please..... Please...... I have been using the app for over 4 years and I would absolutely recommend it to EVERYONE. Pixellab is a must have for mobile editing. But I would love if they added the following: 1. Blending elements. 2. A copied layer doesn't go to the top left. 4. Renaming and choosing the location where to save the file. 5. A bigger \"OK\" button at the text editor, I always misclick the cancel button and the have to type the whole thing again.. I gave a very good feedback to this app for so long but I feel extremely disappointed the way it had turned. I paid a lifetime subscription for the app at the start but I now find that it pops up unnecessary ads and stays so long, to the extent that it most often become so disruptive that I occasionally give up. It's a real shame that it sometimes brings two or three different game apps while I try to save my work. I am very disappointed at all these practices.. In one line, \u201cIt's a near perfect editing app. \u201d Been using this for more than 3 years. It's gets my job done almost everytime... But in 2020, it's feeling a bit backdated. It would've been perfect if it just added a few smart features like \u201cQuick Selection Tool\" and a few brushes... But still, Highly recommended for anyone who's into mobile photo editing!. Excellent App so far... But I will recommend more features to be added not limited to the following: 1. Blend feature. 2. Additional shapes. 3. More shadow option like how far or close (distance) the shadow is from the object when in 3D(Not the direction). 4. More light option: such as type of light, color of light. 5. New Object or Material features: Such as object color texture, selection between Matt, Shiny or Mirror, etc.. It's very beautiful app. My very favorite apps. Best apps for banner design. However, the current update version is much better but there is a problem. When writing a text, it is difficult to move the front side or to make it bigger or smaller as the text is associated with the Auto Rotate font. I hope you will update it as soon as possible. Thanks.. Very nice app but missing an option. You must add an option of feather. Feather option is very important in this app. And when I type some text in urdu in abze regular font then some dots are near the text. Can you fix these problems. I give 5 stars because I am now an editor and I can make posters, thumbnails, logos and many more with this app \ud83d\ude0a. I've been using this app for four years now, so i believe it's safe to say that this it is the best out of all the mobile editing apps out there. it's crazy how there are 0 features locked being a paywall, and the ads are merely a disturbance (they only play after saving an image/project). i wish that we can have go forward a step (opposite to the go back button), a \"blend\" tool that blends the lines and colors, and a \"connect\" feature that lets us pair different objects into one.. The app is phenomenal. There's no ads, it has literally everything you need, it creates high res. photos, It has everything you could ever wish for! Would rate it 25 stars if I could. Great job Pixellab. You are the definition of a good app. (Happy Valentine's day too! <3). I like this app because i can choose a custom size of the picture where i can change to thumbnail,cover art,facebook cover etc.He doesn't have anything to add that i don't want here and this is the best app i have ever used,thank you to the owner of this app.He didn't add even one and its features are also good...The fonts are nice and how they made its contents, just like the buttons to do the progress and much more.Thank you very much thank you! If I could only rate 100 i would have done it\u2764\ud83d\ude0a. The Adobe InDesign for Android. I rarely give rates in any application i use. And this app deserve a high rating. I am using this for a long time now. I can make incredible layout for posters of products with this app. It's easy to use actually. Just be creative and don't be scared to explore features. This is already amazing. But i am still hoping for more updates and additional features soon, and that's exciting! Keep up good work!!. Its realy good... I can do anything I want.. Some time I feel like I am using computer... But I have a humble request to developers that there\u2019s no option for table, so I think if you consider the matter and include a option for table... It will be very much helpful for me and for other users.. Thanks for make such a brilliant application.... As a graphic designer, this app has always been that magic friend. I even had to ditch other apps as Pixellab provides over 80% of what I need on an android environment. A deserved 5 star I give you. I suggest you provide a \"liquid text alignment\" to enable me bend texts along borderlines of image/shapes/objects to enable close-fitting of texts and save space and add a professional appeal.. You deserve more than 5 stars ranking. It does good editing (even if you don't have good background) at least you enabled the users to always export other backgrounds, no ads commotions and it's free. The creation of this app is really a blessing \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f. For me, it really relieved the stress and frustration of the pandemic. Keep it up and God bless the creators of this wonderful app.. Wow! I tried out several youtube thumbnail makers and a bunch other similar apps. Some of them came close to what I needed but non of them had nearly the amount of customisation this app has. Not only this but it is really easy to use too. Everytime I wanted to do something I found what I needed almost instantly. One single thing I miss: The ability to automatically sync projects between devices using something like GDrive or dropbox. I didnt care about the ads but i still bought it on the spot.. I loved this app... More options for customization. Only one problem... While typing malayam Or other languages except english if we use STROKE option it won't give a perfect finish, some dots are there near the words. can you fix that problem ??.... I rated 5 \u2b50... \ud83d\ude07 because I tried many apps, but nothing worked best... And moreover no adds in between editing. After we save, only one add will be there for 5 sec... Thanks.... Ya know, I feel a lot of people use this to make youtube thumbnails on android, And thats what i use this for. Its an awesome app that takes a bit to get used to. Once you start using it more though, you start to feel REALLY comfortable with this application! The fonts are amazing, the quality is really good and full hd, resolution is beautiful, and its overall just a great app! The only thing that annoys me is the ads.

Not only it has many backgrounds,3D options,shadow/reflection options,colors and fonts but it also doesn't have a watermark and it is also super easy to use this has helped me so much with my youtube channel thanks to the creators. Also it lacks two very important features: adding blur to an image and mirroring the image. I hope you add these 2 features it would be awesome", "neg_reviews": "Hi, \"PixelLab\" app is great. But it needs more progress. Features you need to add in the new version: 1. Blend (For image And Text) 2. Eraser (to Erase the text or logo on the photo) This would be great if you could add app features like \"Pics Art\" to the \"PixelLab\" features (both for photos and text). Hope you read my message, thanks.. The sad demise of a once BRILLIANT, trail blazing app. The 3D is still breathtaking but the app is becoming buggy. eg turning your phone to landscape spreads the image across the landscape, then turn back to portrait and hey presto, the image remains landscape. Try doing the same while adding a shape. The shape just vanishes. Saving an image in ULTRA size leaves a blurred and or pixelated edge, rendering the app useless. I don't even know of a good image editing app as Picsay has fallen too. I used to love this app. But at some point recently, it doesn't save my projects correctly. They're not even usable graphics. There are transparent stripes all through my work, it's become too much headache to fool with the app anymore. If this could get resolved, I would then 100% recommend this app.. I have used this app since I was 14 years old, but now it seems that there are so many problems with it after the update. With problems I mean that when you add stroke and emboss, cuts (transparent lines) appear through the text, which can also be seen after saving the text and no matter how I try to remove them, the cuts stay. Please fix this because I really used to like this app and I used it for all my graphic designing projects, but now I can't.. Hlo Dear PixelLab team, A very big problem is happening in Pixellab app for Android users but you guys are not paying any attention to this problem.Using the emboss effect and 3D effect in Pixellab, the image gets cropped. This is causing a lot of problems to Android editors. We hope that you will fix this problem as soon as possible. Thanks. Signature Ks Editz. I've worked so well with this app in 2 different phones (Logicom ID BOT 53 and Poco F1) but it's not working on the Xiaomi Note 8 Pro, I open the app but it's just freezing, after a few secs it exit then.. \"Pixellab Isn't Responding\" sow up. Also I tried older versions of the app, but all with the same problem.. 7/20 update: I really don't want to give up on this app because it was awesome for a long time. But it is still crashing and is basically useless. If you are able to fix the crashing it is a 5 star app (maybe a 4 just b/c of the ads). Was great until a month or 2 ago when it started freezing and crashing all the time. I would give it 4 stars prior to the freezing issue.. the constant ads have become a nightmare. just momenta ago, while trying to save a .plp file, i was shown three 25 second ads: one when I hit \"save as file,\" another one while I was typing the file name for christ's sake, and finally another annoying ad when I pressed save. I'd rather pay for the app than be subjected to such abject misery.. What did you guys do to this app? I use to love your app, not so much anymore. Your ads are annoying to say the least! NOW it keeps shutting down in the middle of a project over and over and there's nothing I can do about it. You need to fix this or I'll be forced to use a different app, and that would be a shame cause I reallly do like this app. Sent from my Sprint Samsung Galaxy S9.. This app export different image than what I create, especially while using emboss on my my Galaxy m51. This is one of the few apps that offer a custom gradient color using HEX. But what I see while editing is not what I get after exporting the image. Developer don't respond to our suggestions or feedback. It was a great app. It's been a year after the last update \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb. If they fix everything, I don't mind to pay for their service.. 1st problem: When I try to save any logo or png in pixellab its shaked itself and the logo change the dimension. \ud83d\ude12 2nd problem: Emboss is not working good. 3rd problem: After adding fonts, when I click on the \"Font\" option, its get time to opening the fonts and after a short time the error appeared that \"pixellab is not working\". Please slove all these blunders.. Not working properly after last update, when you add the stroke effect and save it as an image it doesn't align properly with the word, please fix that issue, it was working fine before this update. Not happy, such a great app, but right now is not doing good.. I used to use this app every day for logos. Now, the embossing doesn't work properly. The 3D text also doesn't work properly. When you save an image in ultra quality the image gets messed up severely. This app used to be great but now it seems like they don't care about it anymore. There is a problem when I export an embossed shape/image/text. And now there is another issue. Sometimes the image/shape is not shown, instead there is a red coloured rectangular shape with a white cross. So I could not export a project made by hours of effort successfully \ud83d\ude21. The app keeps freezing then stopping. Can't do a thing on it. It's not an issue with O. S or anything I just updated and it's still not working with my android version 9.0. Do something. Apparently, it's not just me. It's not compatible with many versions/phones. The app keeps freezing then stopping. Can't do a thing on it. It's not an issue with O. S or anything I just updated and it's still not working with my android version 9.0. Do something. Apparently, it's not just me. It's not compatible with many versions/phones. This used to be my FAVORITE app for design, but once I bought a new phone (Galaxy Note 10+) the emboss and 3D shape features almost like rips up my picture or text when I use them. Those were the two primary reasons I used Pixelab. 2/22/12 - Lowering the stars to one. Not only have they not fixed the Emboss/3D Shape bug, but I can no longer upload ANYTHING to edit. It uploads a blank transparent image no matter what it is! And I PAID for this app! Terrible and I do NOT reccomend!. Lots of good features. But will not stop crashing. I cant use it anymore. I have projects that I cant even finish because crashing. I'd love to give it a higher rating, but I cant use it for anything I need. I've uninstalled and re installed multiple times. I've cleared the cache multiple times. Still having issues. Beyond frustrating.. It glitches when I create text. It worked fine before but as soon as I add embossing to my text it runs lines through the text chopping it up. I resize it to get rid of the lines but when I save my project there still there. Images can be provided if needed. Please fix this it was such a great app on my galaxy s7, I now own the s20+. App keeps FC... I've deleted cache and uninstall n reinstalled the app. Since the day I purchased this app(free from ads) it's been a problem. I'm going to downgrade to a older version to see if that fixes the problem.

There are many apps in play store. but this is the best app I ever seen before. I recommended u all to use this app. If anybody wants to look beautiful then use this app.. Makeup and filters are very smooth / natural and the photos do not become blurry after editing! You can add variety of color contacts that look realistic. Best makeup app ever. Taaz closed down and I found this app after searching thru several others that did not edit clearly to my vision for the photo. There is also pre made makeup for various occasions. This makes it fast and easy with just a touch. You can also change face shapes and blur imperfections which is everything I wanted in an app!!. This app is hands down the BEST photo editing app for fixing imperfections of any kind! I say the best because of how EASY it is...you don't have to do ANYTHING. Just take/pick a photo,and it edits. You have tons of options too with each make up you decide to add like eyeshadow, mascara, ect...I am in no way affiliated with this app this my honest opinion.... Alas! This time it really makes our pix clarity so clear, vibrant, brilliant n stunningly beautiful. Every detailed is so real n it truly upgraded to the maximum perfect n eye lens is so bewitching n pretty. Keep up the good work! Falling in love with it always. Muack! Muack!. Nice app please download it..I know someone is saying that this aap is wastage of time and many other bad things but believe there are many fabulous things for your face. there are also the options of light your mackup and high your mackup I suggest you there are no mackup aaps like this aap really cool. Hand's down the best makeup app and I've been looking for a while, this app can do simple basic make-up or it can make you look straight up fake like a doll, either way its fun to see what you could look like, you can choose different color eye's, change the shape of your nose, it's alot of fun.. Amazing. I like this App. Hope you can add more looks, like the simple ones, the one that looks simple and natural. But I love it!!. this app is good. The make up has many choices from eye brow shapes and color, to hair color, skin tone choices. different eye color. I have had this app for two yrs now. It's never let me down. Never crashed. It's just surprisingly nice... It's great, the only thing is that there should be more colors in the eyeliner function. In general, loved it.. I love this app, I've been using this for months now and I love how my photo turned out. The make up looks natural and doesn't seem to look like it's edited. You can freely adjust almost anything. My photos being edited here looks really amazing. I highly recommend this one.. This app is good especially for taking selfies. But it would be better if the app has more hair dye choices being featured, my suggestion add soft pink hair dye \ud83d\ude06. I love how many options there are to edit. outside of the makeup filters you can customize pretty much everything. -nose width and height editing -make up tone and contouring (includes blush angles) -eye make up :liner, lashes, double eyelid, contacts -lips:color, height of lip to nose ratio, -hair color -pupil size goes on. my too go for editing and taking photos cons: it takes away my beauty mole .im unable to edit with it.. I love this App I wish i could find other apps that work like this one as of now it the onky one i use. Thank you!. this app is almost perfect for me, my only issue is the video recorder, it stop when u remove ur hand. Pls pls pls fix it. this app is the best i never seen any good makup app like this i cant belive this is amazing \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude18. The best makeup photo editor app out there !! Just a little problem, if u offer more options for lip and cheek colour,the app's gonna be awesome !. All time best nd awesome app..awesome picture quality on selfie..and awesome photo editing with one click makeup apply..i give it more than 1000s star.... Am so much in love with this app. D best make up app i ve ever come across. So easy to use, does exactly what i want. I ve uninstalled all other make up apps i had before i found dis one. Thumbs up to u for giving me what i want. I recommend dis app for everyone. Just try it and u will b happy u did. Lots of love. I'm love this app so much, because it has very good items and its don't need any money and it's all free and I think the photos off this app. It's the same. update of this app is very better than this one. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc78\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0e. This is a really good app it works perfectly fine for me I love it but the only thing wrong is the contour it doesn't work on my face but besides that it works pretty good definitely recommend \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d", "neg_reviews": "Initially this application when introduced was awesome. Over period of time it has deteriorated its quality. Pictures get automaticlily updated as per recent looks. This should stop. I want the very first initial Makeup Plus the way it was. Hope you guys do if.. Please get rid of that automatic edit in this new version. Its ridiculous. As a black person im not feeling that pale filter that i cant seem to remove and I only remove bumps and add lipstick when i feel like so all the automatic editing is unnecessary . Im not trying to construct a new face.. We want 2019 version back. This new version is making pictures blur and looks not real. Now smooth option is like other apps it is not making pic clear but blur. Please update again but change this setting. 2019 version was best. It's a humble request to change it's new version. Many of my friends have uninstalled this app because of smooth option which is not working fair. Please update again\ud83d\ude4f. Previously I used to love this app a lot....it gives a very realistic edit and enhances the features quite well....but after the recent update this app is unable to detect the eyes and may be that's y the eyelashes aren't falling at the eyelid well....even if m trying to do it manually still it isn't moving at all....it's making it ugly...please fix this problem. This used to be my favorite. Until the update causes a white filter to go over my picture and an 'acne' editting out automatically that deletes random things like pieces of eyelashes or lines in my hair. I cannot undo these things, leave the decision to me what to edit don't do it for me. I am so pissed off. Won't be using again until it is fixed.. I keep getting \"Face undetected\". Usually before the update even if the face is undetected, there's a manual arrangement of eyes and lips but now there's none. Please get the manual feature back because sometimes it's just a matter of the photo's quality which causes a bit of a blurriness. I've been a loyal user of your apps since 2018, don't let me down now.. I really like it. There are many makeup app, but Makeup plus app is the best app, but it is one problem the lipstick is not so barite so please do well it, and yeah it\u2019s nice\ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude07. Used to love this app but the new version is kinda racist tbh. As soon as I choose the picture that I want to edit, it automatically changes my skin color adding ridiculous amounts of pink blush and making me look lighter and there's absolutely NOTHING we can do to change it!!!!!! Yall tryna tell us to look more like you??? 3/10. Very disappointed. It was my favourite app but now its having some issues . Everytime its blur my pic especially face when I apply any makeup look . I reinstalled it and after that lost some of my favourite looks which I'm looking for to get back but whenever I open the market page Its get all blank .My favourite theme look is Daniel chinchila looks but I'm not finding this in the market because the page is blank not showing any theme look..can I plz fix these issues . I only use this app to edit my pictures.. So SAD! I really loved this app, and had a lot of fun playing with it, but I find I can no longer enjoy it. None of the downloads will download to my device. The app will still allow me to make photo corrections that improve the look of skin and facial features and apply basic filtering, but this is a feature that many apps do. All the fun is gone if I cannot try the downloadable content. Please fix this. I'll have to uninstall if this isn't resolved. Very sad. \ud83d\ude2a. Plz give back the old version. It was s0 real. Some of the new themes are not for use. It looks so fake. Plz make it realistic. Like eye liner, lipstick nd contouring looks so fake. Plz add kajal also very datk bold nd thik. plzzzzzzzzz get rid of the automatic edid in this new version .. It simply go unnatural and fake when it removes all my birth Marks in my face forcibly... and that will push me to uninstall it .. other than that , everything Is more than perfect.. so fix it plzzzzzzz... I used to love the app but whenever i want to upload and edit a picture it automatically customizes my face and makes it looks crooked and rigid. The automated tone selection is also way off. I updated the app thinking it might be an error but it still persists. \ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1f. I like this app very much, but when i update the app last month , so many issues came , can't use customized option, can't change any lipstick color, hair color, eye makeup, etc.. so please fix that issues and update soon... I use to use this app all the time but then I got a new phone and now I had to redownload all the make up themes but it won't download. Just shows a circle on the makeup I wanna use... so sad it's not working anymore.. Makeup filter was not working properly on picture specially problem is in with all lipstick shades..All lipstick shades comes out in blur colour not in deep colour..Proper matte lipstick shade colour is not coming as i use Everyday Salmon Filter. So plz solve this problem as I use only this app to edit my pictures..I always keep updated my app..So I request u too plz solve this makeup filter issue as soon as possible as I suffer this problem for many days n can't edit my pictures properly..Tnku.. After updating the app Isn't working at all!!!. After opening the app and selecting a photo, the app will \"beautify\" of what it thinks your face should look like but doesn't give the option to \"remove\" or change back to the original picture. My face is almost cut in half and my eyes are huge, like an alien. It is funny but why would I want to add make-up to an alien face? This app should me used to as adding funny filters to face rather than a makeup app.. App is sketchy, it opens randomly and keeps giving pop-up notifications that it's closing, even if I haven't opened it in months. It has access to things it shouldn't have access to. There are breaches in the app constantly which have stolen my passwords and debit card information right off my banking app.. I can't edit photos. Whenever I'm about to edit, may it be on live makeup or editor, it has the same result. It turned out to be black n white. I'm using a Samsung S6 unit. I already did some reinstalling but it still not working.

I dont know I just want this feature to be added because if theres a feature like that then the players will always open the app and play with their pet so that it wont die,and if it died they could just spawn a new one.

It keeps on freezing and then it quits on us please fix it other than that it is a really fun game to play with and it is time consuming too I like to play it all day in my free time everyday of the week or weekend.

Boring when playing it for 3 hours.. My little sis cant live without this game. I have played 1,2,3,4,5 but 6 is the best.When you touch its right side head it does some funny stuff.

I have no idea how some people can give this game five stars, either I'm stupid or those these people are just parents who never played this game and have this opinion from their 4 years old kids. why when i want to watch a vdeo it cant open???and always said loading.. rip off mario and tamagochi add horrible mknetisation and you get this disaster. unimaginative boring repetative bs.. This game is boring ,uou cannot enjoy with the pet ,Only there are mini games which u can play\ud83e\udd10. i kind a hate it because the plants need money to buy seeds. game keeps shutting down every 5 minutes.dreadfull and waste of time.

I don't like this game only because I feel like it's not educational and my opinion it's not fun it's kind of like more of a like three year old game and it's not really motivated it's not really fun in my opinion so it's not a game that I would really play or there are really just beyond our the day we met I thought it would be fun but it's really not fun to me. Pretty cool, for little kids, its a cheaper poe and the mini games are other popular games with moy in it, super lame. Hi who is the creator of this App?

Grab a friend and let's start walking!", "pos_reviews": "Love this app. Whether in my hand, my purse, or a pocket, it records everything I want it to. For thosr of us who can't afford a fit bit it's the next best thing. Love that it records day, week, and monthly totals. They are not cleared from mobth to month so progress can be observed. If this is what is referred to as a workout diary I'll answer yes to question below. May not suit others, but works for me. Thank you.. Found I could get accurate results by playing with the built-in parameters. I turn it on and it takes care of everything automatically, even if I forget about it for days or a week at a time. I do recommend it to family and friends. 09-20-20: If you are having problems, try playing with the parameters. I use the metric to measure my step length but ft/in for distance traveled. My walks of up to 8.1 miles are fairly accurate (I'm not a surveyor \ud83d\ude01).. My first couple days didn't go so well, with steps not being recorded, but the app has been great ever since. It's accurate and easy to use. I haven't had any trouble with ads I know how many steps I've gone, at what rate, and how many calories I've burned. It really has stopped me from reaching for a cookie. I'm more mindful of the things I eat when I'm hungry between meals. Since I found this app, it has helped me very much to keep track of my walking since I had back surgery 3 months ago. I had no idea it would take so long to recover (if I do, and I hope so) It is also motivating to know what I have done each day. I use it, and walk every day (almost) plus do the exercises the physical therapist gave me to do. All was smooth sailing for over two months. But now I am having a setback with continuous pain, and the app keeps me walking even though I hurt . Thank. Too many pop up ads. Took over my phone. Ads pop up Everytime time I go to use my phone. Also downloaded similar app didn't realize it was an app was only a trial app. Now somehow they are saying I subscribe to app will automatically charge be charged for app if I don't cancel in 3days. Somehow google play has my billing info save in autofill. Can't cancel app cause it's says it wants me to confirm I subscribed . This app has taken over my phone and pops automatically whenever I use phone. Other applications like this have interesting goals where you can imagine yourself walking across the Sahara Desert at 1200 miles and they have different levels and incentives. This is more a straightforward measure of how many miles you have walked and how many steps you've taken on any particular day and you can arrange it to start at 7:00 in the morning and end at 11:00 at night or something like that and it certainly does the job of measuring how many steps you walk.. An excellen pedometer with a clear well presented feature rich user interface that accurately displays steps, distance, speed, calories and time. Keeps a detailed activity record on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. App solely driven by adverts that take up a significant proportion of the lower screen space. However, once the app is installed, these adverts can easily be prevented from displaying by blocking Internet access to the app using a simple firewall mechanism such as the NetGuard app.. It's really good. It tells you how many metres you've walked aswell as steps, how long it took you, how many calories you've burned and your average speed in km/h. It then tallies your step count into a bar chart so that you can see how well you've done compared to other days and also adds your steps up so you can see the total amount of steps for either that day, that week or that month. You can click back through each day aswell to see your stats. Overall, it's really good for a pedometer app..

However, once the app is installed, these adverts can easily be prevented from displaying by blocking Internet access to the app using a simple firewall mechanism such as the NetGuard app.. App is easy to use and the layout is pretty good. Only issue I can say I've had so far is occasionally the app will stop counting my steps, and I have to exit the app, stop the app from running in the background, and then restart the app and it will update to the correct amount of steps I've taken, but it's still annoying to have to reset it every now and then to get the accurate information. Other than that, I've had it for nearly 2 weeks and it has really helped encourage me to walk more.. Awesome Great app. It keeps counting even when you exit out of the app! My built in Heath app doesn't do any of this... It keeps track of everything for you for months which is really helpful for people trying to reach certain goals, they can actually see their progress daily at a motivator to show them it's not all for nothing. It breaks it down and shows you the calories burned, miles/distance walked/ran, etc.... This is the first time I have ever used a pedometer application and it's pretty useful. Although it counts your steps pretty well, it does have an issue with counting steps while you are driving and sitting still. I understand that it has a meter to factor in the few steps you might take in between trips, but it adds roughly 100-200 steps when driving. All in all a pretty great app.. Love this app! Love the pink background! You can pick your color! :) I picked PINK! :) Also love the layout on the screen....and how big the numbers are for the step counter! Also love how it has daily and weekly at the top...and also a graph at the bottom:) Very cool app! I've used it a lot! Thank you for this app! :). This app is so simlpe to use and it works really well for me. It also tells you how many calories you've used. I just pop my phone in my pocket around the house and keep it in my bag when out, like I'd normally do anyway. Just one tip if your Pedometer doesn't automatically start the next day: turn your phone off and on again. All in all, very pleased. I really enjoyed this app. I'm not a big walker but I'm glad when I did walk I had this app on and working. This app stayed on in the background and didn't even waste my battery. However, my last phone kicked the bucket so as I bought this phone for some reason my app couldn't update or as it says can't download. Not sure why but I might have to delete it.. Pretty straightforward app. The accuracy might not be 100% but it does give one a pretty decent estimate of how much moving around one does. Considering basically everyone has a cellphone in their pockets at all times now, and that this software is free, I'd say give it a shot. If you need absolute accuracy though, you might want to invest into an actual pedometer. Which would be interesting to see how close the two are when both used simultaneously. Very useful and accurate step counter. You have to start it everyday in the morning to count steps. I like the app and will continue to use it.. The App is really easy to work. I was amazed by how I just forgot it was there. One problem is remembering to press Start each morning but that's because I am old! I have a challenge to get up to 4000 steps a day but I nailed it on Day 1 as I was so enjoying the walk.. The pedometer is so reliable, and i don't walk anywhere without pedometer on. Its simple to see the amount of steps and miles walked rather than all complicated gadgets like a fitbit. Its just wonderful to see how many miles i walk a day. It's very accurate too!!-. My favorite it works great, and keeps tracking steps as long as it's open so great even for going biking. I'm shure it's not super accurate when used when biking but I think it gives a good average of how many rotations of the bike was done. I just realized thus app was gone from my phone! @$! I had a tear of progress on it too. :( Please let us connect with our google play accounts, I want to keep track of my progress.", "neg_reviews": "works great, but drains your phone battery. I tried using the settings, when I did...it said I only walked 10 minutes all day. Please fix this, because I really liked this app. I am still using the app, but it is still draining my battery. Too bad the others don't work as well as this one...you really do need to FIX this!!!! Update!! I only give 1 star due to the fact it has stopped twice while walking. I sent an email....no answer. I sent another email today. Don't bother with installing!!!. If you want to use this as the equivalent of a stop watch, it's probably fine. But I found it's far too easy to turn off accidentally if you're trying to log your daily steps. Three times in two days I pulled it out of my pocket or purse only to find it wasn't counting anymore.. This used to be a fine app. I walk the same 5/8 of a mile circling the block everyday with the dog. Varies between 0.60 and 0.67 miles. Then on the 15th of this month it dropped to 0.50, followed by 0.42, 0.19, 0.09, 0.44, 0.39, and today was 0.54. The same 5/8 of a mile block. I deleted the app, and reinstalled it. Maybe this \"hard reboot\" will fix it. It didn't. Installed a second app. In two days new app showed 1.63 and 0.63 miles. This app showed 0.19 and 0.05. This app lies.. Apparently the developer does not provide support. I emailed several times and absolutely no response.. I use to love this app until I realized it was giving me the wrong information. I timed how long it took me to go one way to my destination it was 45 minutes. When I got home I looked at the information on the this app & it said I did the whole walk in 1 hour when clearly it took me at least 1.5 minimum. Now i have to try a different app.. It's fine. It counts steps, calories, distance. Unfortunately, it is easily turned off when you least expect it. I often check my steps at the end of the day to see a big, fat 0. The app regularly stops because I've unwittingly hit Close all Apps. I wish that there was an Always On option. \ud83d\ude14. The pedometer worked GREAT when I started using it (I've used it for a few months), but about a week or so ago, it quit counting most of my steps! Today for example, I physically counted 314 steps (including going up and down my stairs) and it only counted 103 steps! I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, hoping it would help, but it has recorded ZERO steps since reinstallation. The app did recently update on my phone and I don't know if the update has anything to do with it or not.. The restore function running under Android 10 will not hook up to the pedometer app. You get a choice of chrome, HTML viewer, or some other deadly app that has nothing to do with the pedometer app. I don't know whether it's Android 10 or pedometer app for both. You can forget this app working correctly under Android 10. I had the previous incarnation of this app which worked perfectly. Then it disappeared and so I downloaded this version. Despite every possible adjustment available in the app and on my phone, it NEVER starts on its own and often stops half way through a walk. Needs a rethink. I am testing others to replace it. Now, nearly 2 years after the first review, above, I've tried this app again. On my Redmi note 9 pro, it's just as bad. Despite following all the advice, nothing has changed. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e. It stops recording steps at random. I reset it five times since 4 pm and it has NOT registered any steps and I've walked half a mile in that time period. Every couple weeks or so this app stops working and won't register any steps at all. Have to reinstall which losses all your data. This time it stopped recording steps after only 2 days. Won't register any steps at all no matter how many times I shut it down and restart.. I can only agree with the other one star reviews. It used to be a good app but recently it stopped counting most of the steps or it just shuts down. It is terrible now. I have to restart the app every 15-20 minutes during a walk because it stops counting all the time. When I enjoy a walk, I want an app that works but not this desaster.. Used to swear by this app, but in its current state it's just too badly broken; half the time I go out for a walk I come home to find the app has inexplicably closed (no crash report or anything) and so hasn't tracked any steps at all. It has all necessary permissions to run in the background, and I've added to my phone's whitelist to prevent it from being cleaned up to save memory etc., so why the heck is this so unreliable on modern Android? TLDR; this app doesn't work anymore, and there's no sign of it ever being fixed.. Stops working even after you go to the trouble of setting the settings the way they recommend. I've had this app for 8 months now and it continues to let me down at the very worst times what I want to know is why is all of the world of all technology going backwards. 2/19/22: made the mistake of trying this app again with a new phone seem to work fine for a couple of weeks but same old problems it turns itself off even when you give permissions for the battery to be drained. Why is tech so bad?. I've used this app for a few years. In the beginning, I could rely on the app keeping accurate data, but within the last year it is unreliable. Sometimes the app will stall, but the biggest complaint is it not recording data at all. Lately I'm very disappointed. Wish product was as it used to be.. It sucks!, to put it briefly. Many is the time I have gone hiking only to find that at some point during my first hour of walking the app had shut down of its own accord. There seems to be no way to keep it running until the user gives it a STOP command. This app has annoyed me dozens of times. I never really know how long, how far, or how many calories I have lost track of. Please, someone out there who programmed that app, make a way for it to keep running UNLESS I SPECIFICALLY GIVE THE STOP COMMAND. Is that too difficult to do?. Used to be excellent. But in the last 3 to 4 months it's proved to be most unreliable. Today I would have walked at least 5- 6km & it shows 3 kms. Sometimes it does a bit better. Pl do something or this unreliability defeats the purpose of the app. This was a great app counted in the back ground but now if I don't start it everyday it doesn't record anything. That sucks as before I just installed and then got steps tracked without me.doing anything. this sucks. No longer working properly. As an example of this I walked my dog for 55 minutes yesterday, taking my regular route of about 4km as well as all the other movement through the day. According to Pedometer the steps equated to 2.8km over 35 minutes. What's gone wrong?. It was working well but it stuck at zero and I've been jogging for 5 minutes. Please fix it's absolutely incovenient.. The app doesn't work when using other apps anyone would use while working out or walking g etc. I cant listen to anything on y.t. and count steps at same time. Even w both apps open. Just stays put. Disappointing. May try finding 1 that actually works. Dont know too many people who exercise in silence. Lmao. The creators must tho. That would of been the 1st thing I made sure worked w this app. Common sense makers. Most popular music and video app out there. Just saying. Otherwise it works.

Sea World customers are much nicer., however they still leave while food is cooking for others. I gave the app 5 stars because of the food selection and quick cooking time. l will continue to keep cooking but the customers need to know that the ones before them need to be served before last minute customers.. This game is easy at first but then gets harder with every level. Luckily if you pass a level you can earn coins. The coins help you upgrade your equipment so you can do better in the levels. I love making others happy and cooking good food in this game accomplishes that! I recommend this game for ages 10 and up.. One of the best cooking games I have ever tried. The graphics are nice and the different \"restaurants\" (levels) are fun. The levels are of decent difficulty. Unlike most games where you basically have to pay to do everything after the first few levels, you can get gems and energy easily in this game through completing challenges, watching ads, and daily lottery. This is a well designed game.. Very interesting but the only issue is life span of the game, unlike other games, if u win a particular stage, the life still remains the same, it only reduces when you loose a stage, but with cooking joy, the life goes weather you loose or win.. OMG this game is amazing just downloaded it and can't stop playing. The graphics are exceptional, the ease and overall control is superb!!! I think this game is giving every other cooking game a run for their money. Superb!! Still looking for new levels.... Its very nice,no adds affordable things. Is really good game but one thing I don't like about it is that you can't buy the dresses although is affordable (10 coins) but they won't allow you to buy it. Apart from that the game is the best cooking game ever. Oh yes! This is a nice game and is pretty detailed compared to others. Like limited energy which is pretty sad \ud83d\ude25. And she goes to every stand and people to make food and serve food and drinks.. I just love this game and I have been playing this game for 3 months and in these three months complete the first phase i just want to request the organizer that please add more clothes in closet and give tickets to buy colths besides everything I just love this game it's really nice game. This game is a wonderfull game. I like to play this game but I could not get dress coupons to change dress bu I can't. Please fix it.... It is a very nice game. the best thing is that we don't eat food ourselves, we serve it. It's speed is just right for me. It is not too fast not too slow. No changes are to be made in this game. It is already a perfect game for me and for others. maybe is becomes bad if changed any of its controls. I suggest that this game should be as it is.. I like it a lot but the problem is that the are too many costumes at once l often get confused\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15 because l\"am still new\ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udce6 to this game \ud83d\udcf1. I can't play that well\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude36. This game is sooo amazing, i enjoyed playing more than any other. I'm giving it 5 stars cus it really deserves it it's very easy no much ads.. This game is pretty good but level 54 is very hard to complete I have use for about one month to complete level 54but still on it. I love this game it looks true and even if you are out of energy you can still play good job guys a round of applause \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e.. nice game .why don't you available the feature of guild and guild tournaments it's very interesting to have this feature in the game.. My name is herfoo, l love the game so much, i have passion for it. bit it's so hard for someone to move to another level wbich is not supposed to be so.they give little coin at the same timr, but collect it once. The gems demanded is too much. Also, when finishing the lives, one has to wait for longer period before it can be full, that aspect needs to be corrected. I think i need to be given some bonus to improve my game experience and also to be permiyted to have access to some bonus thanks. I really love dis game because it's very helpful, for example if u are unhappy there's no other choice than to concentrate, so at dat moment all ur worries will suddenly disappear,so the only problem is when you are out of(energy) despite the fact, that am still ratting you 5 good star(\ud83c\udf1f). It's a great game....it's so challenging which is fun especially when your time is running out you feel like it's the end for you\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. To be honest.. I didn't like this game at first , but now I play it many times as I love it so I recommend it to anyone loves cooking games.. I first downloaded the fake They named it cooking master, but when I got to level 190 it stoped. They used the same graphics and everything was just like this one. That was why I came here to look for the original and luckily I found this I'm so happy \ud83d\ude0a.", "neg_reviews": "Great game...until you complete everything. The next restaurant is advertised as \"coming soon\" but it's been that way since I installed this game. The last update only added cosmetic items, nothing substantial towards gameplay. The last event looks like it was in early 2019. I believe it's safe to say the devs have given up on this game and give it the minimum amount of thought now. I've uninstalled it.. I'm pretty disappointed that it's glitchy as hell. My character doesn't grab the food when i tell her to at times and the icons above the customers heads look pixelated on the last level that im on. This is stopping me from being able to give them their food and completing the levels. Not a good app.. While it is nice playing a relaxing game, this one isn't as difficult as some of the other games played. I'm around level 34 and I've only had to replay 2 levels. The ads are what kill it for me. Especially in the middle of free energy that is timed. It kills the time on the free energy.. I like the difficulty level of the game. However, I don't like how I beat a level and still loose my hearts. I wish you would make it to where if you beat a level you are aloud to not loose lives. That way I can keep playing. I had to uninstall because it never work. I'm going to try to reinstall it. If it still doesn't work. Update: Im done playing because there are no more levels. Ugh. They're losing people. Add more levels. At least Candy Crush could keep up.. update**** ok this is absolutely ridiculous \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 its now may and im still waiting on an update. if u cant continue the game by making more levels then why not just delete the dam thing altogether. your developers obviously cant do their job. I have now been waiting since January for an update to open new restaurants, u replied to my last review with \"an update will be coming soon\" but still nothing \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 absolutely pathetic.. Was fun until I hit waiting for an update, and have been waiting for a long time with no information. Don't spend money on the game if you are anywhere by the ramen levels or be stuck with unusable stuff until they update, if ever. I am still waiting on the update....I downgraded to a one star due to lack of communication and updates by the programmers. I have been waiting almost a year and no one will answer contact requests.. Shame. I finished the island on cooking joy \"1\" to find there are no other levels. My disappointment was lessened when I saw a CJ\"2\"! But after playing about 1/2 hour, I unistalled it. Boring, too easy, harder to understand the \"rewards\". I wish they had just made more levels on the original version. Edit *I guess there isn't a 3.*. Loved the game until the end. Spent money on diamonds, etc., only to play the last restaurant before the restaurants 'coming soon' alert. Had no idea the app wasn't fully developed otherwise I would not have spent the money. Tried contacting the developer twice to no avail. In these tough times, the least they can do it respond. Google is investigating.. Hey I enjoyed all the levels of this game.. but there was a problem. I'm waiting for 6 months but the next levels are not coming yet. Still waiting. A new update is needed to open the next levels. Otherwise I will uninstall this game and suggest others that don't download this game\ud83d\ude21. Game is ok, rewards for passing levels are skimpy, too long to build lives to play, can't erase data and start over, and the worst part is you get to a level that you can't move on to the next restaurant. You get all the levels just to see a message about next restaurant coming soon. Then you wait a few months and there restaurant never appears. Refresh, dump cache, reinstall all to no avail. No update either. The game is overall fun to play but bogus. Crappy job, developer needs education.. the game is enjoyable, but you lose a life even if you clear a board. I been waiting two days for the other boards to open, I'm about to delete the game all together. How long do you have to wait for new boards? I've been waiting for a month or more, about to delete the game all together. Are there anymore boards coming?. I don't know how this is possible but I have the same game but different names one is cooking master and this one is cooking joy I just imagine how this came to be well I have a lot of issues with this app when it gets to a level you get stuck there or you either uninstall the app cause that level is impossible to win without using a booster and the time even start counting before the customers made order please do something about it please. The game cheats really bad when you get to high in numbers of the game it won't let you push the item that you want, also the item are to close to each other so when you push one item you get another. I like the game it got some things that need to be worked out.. The ads have killed the game. Just opening the game can pop an ad. Want to go into settings? Watch an ad first. Going to play a level? Sure, after this ad. Finished the level. Great! Here's an ad to watch to celebrate your victory or while you grovel in defeat. No matter what the situation, you can be sure that an ad will pop before, during, and after whatever you try to do.. Some levels are designed such as they can never ever be cleared untill you use a booster. This is totally irritating that all my lives keep going and level doesnt get cleared no matter what you do.. Absolutely love the game, but it's annoying to always have to play an advert just to access settings, also the lives part can be improved, cant wait for over 25min for one chance to play a stage, and then wait another 5min to progress to the next stage even though I didn't loose a live\ud83d\ude44 In terms of purchases if they can get us to buy a storage area and when leveling up an assistant should do.. NOT PLEASED I have played Cooking Joy. I love it it so when I realized Cooking Joy 2 was available \"I was like YEA BUDDY\"!!! Of course when you first play any game its AMAZING!! But soon after something comes lurking out. The game response to your selections DEFINITLEY has a slight delay. I thought this was in my head or poor connection. So I returned back to Cooking Joy to just analyze this a smidgit more, with every selection the repsonese was quick w/o any extra boost added.. have been stuck on level 190 for over 2 months, I've emailed and used customer service to reach out to someone with no response. I have all my keys top move on but there isn't an update option in settings. Do not download this game!! Its intended to lure you in and spend money to get further, however once you get to the Ramen level, just says coming soon - been saying that for almost a year now. I didnt want to uninstall and feel like i wasted my money. I still go in every so often in the hope there are now more levels, but there never is. This game is a scam!!. Its fun at first then whenever you get on up into the game of course it gets harder but the time doesn't allow you to finish the orders before the time Runs Out and you can play the same game for three weeks in a row and never get enough time it cuts it off before you can even play if it doesn't fix momentarily I'm going to just delete it not worth it", "pos": "Negative reviews for Cooking Joy 2 highlight the following key points:\n- Customers leaving while food is cooking for others\n- Confusion with too many costumes available at once\n- Difficulty in completing certain levels, like level 54\n- Demanding gameplay elements such as collecting gems and waiting for lives to refill\n- Limited energy, which can be frustrating\n- Desire for additional features like guilds and tournaments\n\n", "neg": "Users dislike the lack of updates and new levels in Cooking Joy 2.

I love all the Rare Capsule events and Starter Discounts and even extra goodies you get by logging in! One thing that I love are the intros that you get every time you log in. Everything is well-written and beautifully placed. I love all the features that make you never want to stop playing! This game is absolutely incredible. I love that you can even transfer your data to a different device, though I would recommend to allow multiple devices to play on one account. Yes, there are some ads, but only if you choose to watch them. Being an P2W (pay to win) is optional and not required, which I love, and may help you to progress in the game (like buying Cat Food) but is not needed to win. I'm a F2P (free to play) and I love it so much even though I can't spend as much money on it as I would like to. 100% would recommend!. Man, is this a good game! However, I do have some ideas for it. First, a multiplayer mode where you can fight other players online. Second, the option to make your own cat. Of course, you would have to use cat food (more if a super rare instead of a rare, uber rare instead of super rare, etc.) or a reward for completing a special/hard stage. Thirdly, a trading system. And lastly, maybe a gifting system for friends. That's all the ideas I have for the game! Please put in the gifting system.... Really good game, but watch out for the difficulty spike. My advice, have a lot of patience, as failure is to be expected. Invest your time in going back and collecting treasures to upgrade your overall power. Don't listen to these reviews of people who blew money on this game to no avail, as they probably didn't make it past the first 3 chapters. Besides that, 5 stars. No forced ads, not pay to win, just a really quirky and fun experience! By the way if you are still stuck, check the wiki site.. Battle Cats is an excellent game. Loaded with cool, fascinating and amazing features and characters, it is an incredibly diverse and intriguing game to play. I have literally been playing this game since 2019 and haven't deleted it at all. However, some levels in Battle Cats can be a little tough and intense, but I guess that's what the game's about.. I looooove this game, I've been playing for 4 years now and I still love it. It is so easy to play, but challenging too. And to all the people saying \"It's so hard to get cat food, it's a pay to win game!\" NO ITS NOT! As a beginner there is no need for cat food yet because ubers aren't necessary yet, and it's easy to get cat food once you clear the first world and get the legend stages, just do them and bam cat food! I never got an uber till into the future. I love this game, nice game PONOS! \ud83d\udc96. This is one of my favorite games that I've ever played in my life, but the only problems are the energy, the extreme amounts of luck you have to have to get 1 good uber that can actually help you make progress in the game, or an epic catfruit or an epic catfruit seed, or relic catfruit (seeds), the way the save data and transfer works, and the game is uncomfortably slow. In almost every other game on the planet, speeding the game up is free, and I think it should be free on this game too.. This game is long-term, this game is a very long-term process and you will have to accept failure as part of the process no matter how good you are. I love it, I have spent over a full year playing this and I have so far from run out of content. It's free to play 'friendly' with good resource management and there is no multiplayer to force competition but trying to get units you want maybe a little bit up to luck. Watch a guide or two and spend some time before passing full verdict.. I used to play battle cats a long time ago, I've returned to it and I'm really happy to see it hasnt changed, not really any ads, fun gameplay, and the advice cat is still very funny, also the cats are cute, cool looking, and strong at the same time, and the game is just so much fun despite the gameplay being kinda simple, although still requiring a lot of strategy to complete harder levels. All in all a great game, and this will always be one of my favorite original games.. This game is actually really fun, I played since 2019 and it's pretty good. Problems are that this game doesn't connect with google play so when you lose your progress its lost forever. Either way you can just screenshot and it's fine. Another problem is that it takes some time to load in, but all you gotta do is be patient. This game also doesn't have any ads in it. I also like the collabs and this game is special mostly because it can be played online and offline.. There is so much to do in this game! Several different chapters and stories means you will have plenty of levels with different enemies to take down. This game is easily played on the go or at home, and if you have to leave mid battle you can simply pause and close the app, then resume the battle when ypu open it again. So many different cats, with evolutions and true forms for most. I have been playing for about a month now and i am nowhere near completing the game, there is so much to do.10/10. This game is simply amazing. It's one of the few mobile games that isn't a platent cash grab. It keeps you hooked with collecting cats (which feels so rewarding) and the combat is great. It's a challenge but is also acclopishable if you give it enough time and paitence. I would recommend this game to anyone and if you don't like the game whatsoever, just uninstall it. Its free after all!. I LOVE BATTLE CATS!!! It is now my favorite mobile game. Thr gameplay never get stale, there's always something to do and they don't shove ads in your face like other mobile games. There are so many different enemies. There's so many cats you can unlock and you get to keep the collaboration cats they give you. There's so much to do but it's not overwhelming. I love the pace of play. You won't be able to do alot in the beginning but when you lvl up you have access to more stuff. I \u2764 everything.. This is a superfun game with a variety of stages and cats. There are some levels that are really hard in the beginning until you look up how to beat them. Then you beat the level, feel good and move on to the next level. The gacha part of the game has its ups and downs, however the feeling of getting a new Uber never gets old. I also like how ALL the cats can be used in some way even if only in a few stages. I do think that Ponos should add a tiny bit more 100% Uber draws. 0 ads. Great game.. This is a superfun game with a variety of stages and cats.

Getting the Cats you want is completely by chance. I guess you could pay to play, but I know that i have paid only for gold tickets and once for a premium ticket. i have gotten some great cats and alot of repeats. But this game has been great ever step of the way, from the collaberations to the events. highly recommend this game for those who like challenges, want a solo game. This is easily a classic for me.. The Battle Cats is a game I have played for a long time, I just have lost progress multiple times due to a family member deleting the game, but other than that, it is a great game with hundreds of cats ranking from normal to legend rare. It is a game of strategy. For instance, in some levels there are certain enemies that are strong against some units, but weak against other's. I just wish that the cat capsules and rare capsules were easier to get. I would recommend this game to anyone. 5 stars.. After looking at some critical ratings: 1. No, you embrace what you call \"ancient\" technology. I've never seen the code restoration before in mobile apps and I think it is a very solid way to get your data back. 2. Those time set errors are also linked to wifi, if you have an unstable wifi connection, it will give you the error. After all of that, I give this game 5 stars still. And thank you Ponos, for this great game. \ud83d\udc4d. Truly a perfect game. There are almost no flaws and an endless amount of units to use, upgrade, and true form. So many stages and unique traits of cats and enemies. So much content. This game may start out slow, but be weary, it gets very challenging later on. And the best part, there are no force ads at all. Download it, you won't regret it.. Amazing really fun and addicting game. If you are looking for a game to kill time or to just have fun this is the game for that. There are only ads when you choose to watch them. I absolutly LOVE the aspect of having to unlock new cats by playing levels. Also this game never gets boring because once you finish the main story of the game there are special stages that come at special times. Thank you ponos for making this amazing game. I really hope you download this game because it is so fun.. Entertaining, exciting, long-lasting, and great customer service! The game itself has tactics you have to learn and many different key components that make you think and act upon. The game is a gacha so in-game purchases are very much available for pulls. Finally the customer service is great! I lost my account and they reached out to me within 24 hours of each email and I got my account back in less than 2 days. (remember they have a small team so this is very impressive). Anyways, it's great.", "neg_reviews": "WARNING: IF YOU GET SEIZURES PLEASE DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. I played the first level, and after it they have many buttons and icons that flash red to blue, and it gave me a serious problem. it seems fun but literally can't play it. I suggest if your prone to seizures or get migranes that you don't play.. Sad. You get to a certain point and it's just awful. I love this game so much, but it's sad that you can only play for about 15 minutes every 6 hours. The energy you have and the cost of energy to play stages is totally out of scale. 200 energy(of 660) to play a single stage. Play it 3 times and boom.... see you in 6 hours, unless you want to spend real money to play more. This game would be better without energy or with the energy glitch returned. It's a real shame. Really fun game but a focus on getting cat capsules ruins it if you want to upgrade your cats. Tried doing one of the ads to get 5000 free cat food to purchase said capsules and after doing what the deal asked of me they refused to give me the cat food, took almost a month to complete. Tapjoy blames me for having a proxies or changing my I'd which I never did and straight up emailed me that they wont pay. I did a candy crush deal right after and I was paid immediately for a meager 30 cat food.. Suddenly cannot login, being playing this game more then 2 years, suddenly said my save data is against violation of battle cat software agreement. i never did any hack, just play as normal. the company just stop me.. Fun game, but unbelievably unbalanced. The \"difficulty\" rating of events is basically meaningless, as it has no relationship with reality. The difficulty in that game is purely based on the money spent as if you dong have the right cats to deal with specific events then they could be far below tge difficulty of you current best result but still be h 100% impossible. it os fun but it is heavily let down by complete lack of balance.. i give you two star because how impossible the level is. easy to play from beginning, start to getting hard but stil able to win, then suddenly goes to impossible within 1 level. there was 4 pingun boss with 1 pig and 1 hippo spawn together at a time. all my defense wipe out within 10 sec. and all my cat were impossible to attack them. area damage one hit kill. and also no info about HP, damage, and etc. you just blindly upgrade cat without know how effective they would be.. It's loading 1/12 it's been two days it's still loading I don't even know what the game is about because I can't play it worse game ever I just deleted and it's so bad y'all need to fix this cause it's just bad for it. lost all the cats i paid for after my phone fried. i spent lots of money on this game (over $25) and it's all gone and I'll have to start from the beginning again. don't think i can get over the loss.. overall the game is good and I would give a higher rating if it weren't for the in-game cat food (summon credit) problem, you can get the cat food by watching ads or by completing tasks outside the game. I downloaded an entirely different game just to get 1200 cat food and did the tasks but it never showed up in game in fact I've tried to do this twice and for both tasks I received nothing. this wouldn't be that big of a deal if getting cat food in game happen more often or at higher yields.. I've been a long time player of this wretched cesspit of a mobile game, for years this has been my promethean punishment. To come so close to success only to be defeated by a paywall. To say this is pay to win is an understatement. I could put the entire net worth of warren buffet into the in game shop and still not have enough buffs. This is tourture. This is my personal hell. It had taken everything from me. My sleep, my friends, and (allegedly) my sex life.. It's a really simple and obnoxious game designed to irritate you into paying money because you keep almost winning. I'm sick of cheesy pay to win games. And, I no longer care. Every time I upgrade it just gets harder. It ceased to be \"fun\" long ago.. It's quite a fun game ,has a lot of content, and there's always something new to keep you playing. It's such a shame though that I lost my data twice now for NO REASON, I didn't change devices, I didn't uninstall then reinstall, I was playing yesterday normally, then I opened the game today just to find all my data gone. I just wanted to know why did that happen, and of I can restore it somehow.. The game is really great but there is a HUGE flaw with it. If your phone breaks you loose your account. My phone stopped working with no warning and I lost my account on wich I spent a lot of money on. I got everything else except my account back from the phone because there was no way for me to get it back without the phone working I wanna play again but I don't think I can get back into it after 2 WHOL YEARS of playing it. Please fix it and tell me if there is anyway for me to get my account.. The game is fun but it is very grindy. Also, I am giving this low rating because of a glitch that happened. I was transferring the data to my phone, but it crashed. I tried it again, but it kept crashing. I decided to cancel the save transfer, since it wasn't transferred. Unfortunately, it stated that it DID transfer, so it made me restart. Please fix.. This game is funny, the cats and other assets are detailed, I loved it; however, the company haven't given me anything back, no emails back, nothing when I switched devices, I have them my ID number for the game, but, they won't do anything. I despise them for that, and I've spent a couple grand on the game; I know, not good, but I also mentioned that to them, nothing, at all, no emails no nothing, and I'm thoroughly pissed.. Amazing game overall, but the reason I am rating it one star is because I lost all my data to an error and Ponnos isnt bothering to help after i sent them multiple emails with all the data I can remember and the code to restore the account. My problem is that I never got the confirmation code, so I send the code I know, and they reply whith a complaint saying it isnt 9 digit, so I check and send a new email, with a 9 digit code, and they reply exactly the same.please help me get my account back.. My son had this game for a couple months enjoyed it so much, he received an error message and was locked out of the game. Word of advice to future purchasers , please read the bad reviews and note that it is a rip off and they do not take the time to correct the errors nor do they contact you when you submit a cliam.

The game was great until I got banned. My friend hacked me 58,000 cat food and a billion exp and I just about completed the game. Then yesterday, a couple months later, the game said that I cant play on my save file because it breaks their terms of service, and I deleted the hack files, but it is still not letting me play. Before my friend hacked my game, I was on the 3rd chapter. 4 months of progress lost.

This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.

This app is awesome if you forget your passwords frequently or want to add an extra layer of security.. The downside is if you change your password and do not have another way to verify your account (send a code to email or phone number) then you're locked out. Make sure your contact preferences are set before linking your account! Also I have noticed the app doesn't link a lot of services; just Facebook, Microsoft, and Google accounts. I'd like to see more accounts able to be linked.. If you have the active/subject phone in your hand, once you have access to the authenticator phone - the device (remote or native) that hosts the authenticator app - it's only you who can authorize access, because you're still faced with a decision-making challenge; a simple one, but nevertheless, a challenge that's not a default step. It's quick, easy, convenient, and above all ... BRILLIANT!. To my surprise, the Microsoft Authenticator App has helped me through some scary and frustrating times, it did exactly what it said it would do. It's easy to understand/follow, which gave me a sense of calm confidence. Taking away that defeated feeling I had before when using other Authenticators, when I'm tryin to recover my accounts. Nothing's worse than an assistive App that doesn't assist you. Instead takin you on a ride of its own, not doing anything it said it would do. Great job Great App. The reason I prefer this app over the big G's one is that this one has cloud backup. If you've had issues with Google losing your info due to server issues or, more commonly, lost/stolen/broken/new phones, you'll know how invaluable it is that Microsoft allows your credentials to be backed up so you're not locked out of everything. I had this as a one-star review because of a security flaw that was fixed REALLY fast by Microsoft. That is great and another reason to recommend this app (Google had the same flaw, no idea on if theirs is fixed, but to anyone using their authenticator, you REALLY should make sure it's been patched). Overall, straight up usability of the few authenticators I've tried, I really do prefer this one quite a lot over the others. It does what it should. It's quickly patched in case of security flaws. Super recommended.. When it works, it really works. Fast, easy to use, and secure. Occasionally the push notifications are a bit delayed, and once every now and then it doesn't receive the notification at all, but that's pretty rare. The app experience is as seamless and effective as Google's device notifications. Here Microsoft is showing other companies what 2-factor authentication should be, and just how pleasant the experience can be.. Using this app on three accounts so far and everything is fine. Simple, clean interface is fairly intuitive to set up and use. After several months of using it nearly everyday for my Microsoft account and less often for others I am happy with how it functions and see no need to look further. I have encountered no problems. Easy recommendation.. Works great. Have been using this for 5 years for about 30 accounts and never ran into issues. I only need to use my phone's finger print to log into pages and apps on any device. You can add phone numbers, emails etc, incase you lose your phone too and sync to the cloud if you want to use the app on multiple devices. This makes it take about 30s to switch devices too. Must have if you want to keep your accounts secure. I use it for MS, facebook, amazon, ebay, etc.. Works flawless. I especially like the push notification support. MFA is pretty much a requirement in this day and age for security. I've read some of the one star reviews and they are petty complaints that show a lack of understanding of what MFA is for and how it works. Yes you can get locked out of your account if you loose your phone, but that is not the apps fault. You should always register a second MFA device or save your backup codes. VPNS are not replacements for MFA you should use both.. I've been working with online security options since the late 80s. A lot has changed in that time but one thing that hasn't, and that is the need for secure authenticating when you are online and expecting a secure and trusted connection. Two step confirmation is critical in today's online applications. This MS Authenticator has always worked and worked well. I highly recommend it.. Microsoft account authentication works well, the notifications are prompt and easy to use. It even works with my school Microsoft account, very convenient. By default it puts the app behind a fingerprint, which is a nice touch. I use a different password manager on all my devices so I've never used that feature, but it's nice to see they added the sync option.. This app gives me two step authentication - I have to enter my PIN and then my password from the password wallet on my phone or computer can then be used to sign in to my various applications. Sometimes it can be a little annoying, but then I realize it is keeping my accounts safe. Entering a four digit PIN is a small inconvenience in exchange for not having to remember dozens of passwords. It works across platforms as well, which I find to be helpful.. perfect security and very simple to use. I recommends stronger and safer passwords, greater levels of security with multiple devices needed to be able to access your accounts on new and old devices to help keep your personal information private and only accessible by you. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who has a microsoft account. I'm just a regular gamer, I thought my accounts were secure before but after being hacked. Microsoft authenticator came highly recommended.. I love this app\ud83d\ude0d!!!! It's awesome to have and it's super helpful every time! It has never let me down when I needed it to get into any app without using my password because I had forgotten it. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs help with getting into your apps when you can't remember passwords or etc. You won't be disappointed! Keep up the great work guys. Make more awesome apps that work like they're suppose to. Thank you! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd. So long as you are operating it on a newer device or one with enough ram to move quickly, it's very nice. Otherwise it'll move slowly and you might even have to have it open to recieve notifications (tested on various phones). But as the devices were cheap, it was to be expected - you get what you pay for. Love the app, would love to see the security coding as I am studying such topics in college right now.. I really like this app. It has worked almost perfectly and adds an additional later of security. Occasionally I get frustrated because, when adding a site for authentication using QR, you cannot specify what it is named. You have to search the list and rename it there. This should be one in a number of practices that anyone online absolutely has to follow. Always remember that you are only as safe as your device and have a back up plan if you lose control of it.. If you use Microsoft, you MUST have this. It adds an extra level security that is super easy to use. HOWEVER! Only use this if you have a smartphone or or tablet and make absolutely certain you write down your Microsoft account name, password, and PIN. If you lose those, you might never get logged back in. Commit them to memory.. As far as I can tell this app works really well. I only use it for two accounts, and rarely use it but it seems to work perfectly. The only weird thing is that it seems to never stop generating codes even if you only use the app for a few seconds or minutes a year, but I guess that does not devalue the app. Funny how I see MS responding to some feedback here. Would be nice if they fixed Windows 10 which totally sucks - just give me a little bit of functionality and the ability to personalize my PC, that's all I'm asking... [Update] 5+ Stars. It was not super obvious but I had to add a second account with similar login information and I was able to rename or re-title all my accounts; SUPER HELPFUL!", "neg_reviews": "Can't understand this sudden annoyance to demand I sign in every time I log in from a different device. Never happened before. All to do with the fact that I have several email addresses using the same mobile number. It looks like security taken to an extreme. Pretty soon we will have to resort to sending messages via paper & pen. Great modern progress Microsoft? What next Tablets made of stone?. The app is decent, but it is in dire need of an interface update. Handling more than a handful of authenticators is tedious. Make it a grid with user configurable icons (and for the love of God, give us a few common ones by default) and show the code when we click on the grid item. Also, search. This app could be so much better. Edit: It has recently improved somewhat. Definitely a step in the right direction, with a more compact default view. Edit: Custom icons when?. Doesn't work, I tried setting this up for personal and work email accounts but it never got past the screen where it tells me to login to the authenticator app. I login to both the browser and app and they never sync. What's wrong with just using phone numbers to text the code? Why does Microsoft make this the default authentication when it's the most difficult to get working. Had to read up on how to disable the app altogether and just go with sms messages to my phone.. A great way to lose access to all your work accounts when you buy a new phone, unlike Google's authenticator, which allows transfer to your new device. When you go to Microsoft's support page for help, you are instructed to click things that don't exist or redirected to irrelevant information. From the people who brought you Internet Explorer??. While the app works most of the time, sometimes it's very frustrating to use it. Recurring issues include - 1) Not receiving push notifications. 2) Sometimes to get push notifications, I have to refresh manually from within the app, which is not intuitive at all. 3) Recently I get an error message on trying to refresh manually as well. It's impossible to login to my account in those situations. 4) The code generated is not recognised when trying to login.. For a person who constantly gets a new phone, there will be issues. Clound sync only overwrites the data. I have found no way to import the data from the cloud. It's like write-only memory, what's the point? Maybe it's an issue with me, but even then, a more intuative UI would solve the issue. Please help me find out how i can import my accounts from my old backup, i don't want to have to fish for my recovery codes, unlink and relink my accounts _again_.. Unfortunately, despite being visual well made, and simple. This app doesn't work for me. It has never worked, update after update, nothing changes. I get notifications when I tried to sign in with the app, but when I put in my password or use my fingerprint it just seems to not work, repeatedly giving me the option to put my fingerprint again and again then cancelling and saying that I had too many attempts, forcing me to sign in with an alternative way.. The app has not been working properly for three days. Tried to report it, but nothing happened. It's like clockwork, almost every 20 minutes two notifications will pop up from the app saying: \"Unfortunately, Authenticator has stopped working.\" I can't open the app at all, and now it's affecting the emails I can see through my phone. Notifications come in, but I can't view ANY OF THEM! I don't know what that last update did, but I need it to be solved.. I was using it fine but something went wrong with my phone and I had to reset & redo it. Now authenticator does not trigger at all. I tried accessing my work emails from the outlook app on my phone & on PC, but can't get in because there's no notification that comes up on the app, no code, no reaction, nothing. I don't know what to do, tried rebooting, uninstalling, reinstalling, nothing is working.. I started using this app about a year ago and I absolutely loved it! Even wrote a fabulous review however after purchasing a new phone I found that when transferring the data from the old to the new... surprisingly the Authenticator app that I had grown to reli on didn't transfer everything. Which was about the time I had forgotten password to the email address I use for \"Important Mail/Legal etc \" which is when I also discovered that Microsoft doesn't exactly assist you in get ur password!!. This app is a f.ing nightmare. Here's an example of an infinite loop you get stuck in. Trying to add account, press add account, asks for email, then TELLS YOU TO APPROVE THE CODE IN THE APP, YOU CAN'T YET ACCESS. Some big brain stuff there. So I click log in a different way, which leads to resetting my password and NEVER LOGS ME IN. Fun times.. Worst app EVER! My phone quit working and I needed to use the Authenticator. Here are the instructions from Microsoft: \"If you can't use the APP right now get a code A DIFFERENT WAY.\" They only have 2 options to get the code \"a different way\" \"if you can't use the APP.\" (1) \"Approve a request on my Microsoft Authenticator APP.\" (2) \"Use a verification code from my mobile APP.\" Both work-around options require you to use an app they know you can't use. It's the reason you need a different way.. The app doesn't show notification consistently when I am trying to login to my work account. When it shows notification, even though I approve it displays \"Denied\". I don't know whether this issue is happening in my phone only!! This application seriously needs some fix. I request the concerned team to look into this asap.. It works great for what you expect it to do at first, I especially like the \"passwordless\" sign-in options that it provides for Microsoft accounts. However! When you buy a new phone, reset your current one, or for whatever other reason you use a new phone there's no method to transfer the existing accounts/codes over. So you either need to manually connect each account again on the new device (good luck getting that to work if your phone is broken...) or keep your old phone around just for the codes. The lack of a secure back-up/transfer option is highly annoying and can cause the user to be locked out of their accounts.. Inconsistent program performance is typical. Upgrades always means poor performance for 24 hours. Today, after you tell me my pin is not available, my password doesn't work, I change my Microsoft password so I can reset the pin. MS accepts new password. First try to use it...nope. Not the right password. You are burning my time like you get paid to do it. WHY is MS only consistent about it poor performance and lack of customer support? 25 years of this has burned me out. Apple is looking good.. Microsoft has hit a low level by creating this app. I signed out of my acc, then tried to login in but it was greyed out ,after reinstalling there comes a new issue. \u25a0Authenticator itself is asking for code which Authenticator generates???\u25a0 When the hell you were going to mention a backup account??? Well the developer who made this only knows loops...this is an infinite loop and my work account is stuck in this loop.. 15% battery usage draining battery as of Oct update. Neess to be fixed far sooner than later. 5 to 2 stars.. It mostly works. But some push notifications are lost or you need to open the app to get prompted. Years in and it still doesn't have a dark mode (despite the rest of O365 having it), which is pretty bad for an app with like 4 screens. Also the autofill stuff doesn't work if you have an work/school account - so most people who would use this app.. Application keeps on saying that has no internet connection however I have an internet connection. The only way to let most authentication commands go through is by using mobile data. In order to sign into an account you have to use data instead of Wi-Fi. I still don't know why this hasn't been fixed yet it's been over a year. Even most authentications fail constantly.. This app barely works every time it makes me go through the multi-factor. When I sign into my school account I have to try logging in multiple times because it barely picks up any notifications from my school account. This service has become extremely stressful and it is getting in my way of performing effectively at my school.", "pos": "Negative reviews for Microsoft Authenticator:\n\n- Need a log out button and option to clear app data.\n- Limited service linking, would like to see more accounts able to be linked.\n- If you change your password and can't verify your account through email or phone, you're locked out.\n- App can be slow on older devices.\n- Difficulty in naming authentications when adding sites using QR codes.\n- Continuous generation of codes even with minimal app usage.\n- Must be used with a smartphone or tablet, and risk of being locked out if account details are lost.\n- Limited functionality in renaming accounts and personalizing the app.\n- Delayed or missed push notifications at times.\n- Occasionally frustrating when notification not received.\n\n", "neg": "Negative reviews summary: \n- Users struggle with the process of adding and syncing multiple accounts, especially personal and work email accounts, leading to frustration and difficulty in logging in.\n- The app lacks a seamless transfer option for accounts when switching to a new device, causing users to lose access to their accounts.\n- Inconsistent push notifications and errors in refreshing manually within the app result in difficulty logging in and accessing accounts.\n- The app drains battery significantly, lacks a dark mode, and has issues with internet connection reliability.\n- Users encounter an infinite loop issue when trying to log in, leading to being locked out of their work accounts.\n- Lack of customer support and poor performance after upgrades contribute to user dissatisfaction and frustration.", "summary": "-", "features": "-", "adjectives": "-", "search_term": "-"}, "com.nway.wweundisputed": {"app_name": "WWE Undefeated", "description": "Play the newest WWE mobile game featuring real-time head-to-head competition.

It works just like power rangers legacy. Edit: it's actually better than I initially thought. And it's definitely not pay to win. I just hope female characters will be added. Pre-update, this game was quickly becoming my favorite all time mobile game. Nonstop action plus no ads. I could play as much as I wanted and I'd be rewarded as such. There have been some ups and downs, but as of the newest update, this is the best mobile game ever made, graphics, game play, and reward wise.. Okay so. This game is phenomenal. Good on the eyes, the animations register, it's smooth, creative, and the process for climbing in the ranks...imo...is pretty perfect. Some of the moves, like the fiends teleporting finisher, are CHEEESEE. Overpowered AFF. But. He also has his downsides, so if you're great with your primary character...you should do very well. ALL THAT SAID...there is an update...and I can't update it. And unfortunately...I just built an addiction to this. So let me back in!!. This is actually a very good game only two things really need to be fixed. Number 1: Input Delay, sometimes when you press a button to do a move it doesn't register. Number 2 : Connection Issues , sometimes I get dropped from the match and lose. The gameplay / graphics / animations / rewards are very decent. It's not really a skill based game but it does still take strategy to win games. You got to know all your opponents moves to determine the animations for their strike moves and distance they can hit. Some grapple moves stun and opponent and some grapple moves leave the opponent of the floor for a long time so you can do ground moves. I wish they were other wrestlers in this game like Bret Hart / Shawn Michaels / Kane etc etc but I think the roster for now is great. There is a wrestler that will suit everyone's style I personally prefer powerhouses my current favorite being Drew McIntyre because despite his size he has decent speed. Save up your gold if you don't want to spend money in the game. Join a faction has soon as you can so the time for reward boxes is reduced. Save up your Battle Bucks and only upgrade the moves you actually use. The higher the level of a move the more powerful it becomes. My Drew is a level 3 but all my moves are level 5 and above. Hope you all enjoy the game.. i love they game the gameplay is so realsic it has everything you would ever want in a regular match but what if there was a no disqualfucaion match and the use steel chairs , kendo stiks , ladders and tables in regular moves , that would be sick. you can relive rivalry like the new day v uso, shawn micheals v bret hart and yiou can be the oppnett that you were in favor more and chage they way of the historic wwe match like mabye undertaker retired not losing his streak . and have fun. Obviously the best WWE games for Android devices,- Pros are 1> Great animated moves, Looks so damn cool 2> Matchmaking is super balanced. 3> You can grind your stuff by opoening chest time to time or buying rosters. 4> They never gonna irritate with buy stuff from ingame store. if anything new arrives for 1-2 days and thats okay. CONS 1> only cons I found is game got freezed sometimes and quit thr app automatically 2> There should be way to check online faction members. thanks.. This is awesome game, and i really enjoying it. I will keep playing it since its really fun . However i got a few issues here. (1) Entrance BGM sometimes gone a.k.a mute and same goes to K.O pin annoucement (happen all time, i dont think there is any K.O pin annoucement). (2) There isn't any entrance in match sometimes. (3) Bug in upgrading card in deck, which the upgrade button doesn't show up regularly. Suggestion: If its possible. Tag team with friend for 2 v 2 match would really great.Tq. Best WWE game to DATE. The rest are a sorry excuse of a bad idea/no budget. Example the card game that WWE made for mobile users, now that game I feel sorry for. But this, this is nice. Keep developing this game by adding more players and cool attacks that is unique to each fighter. Keep up the good work.. This a really fun game to play. It allows you play against anyone in the world and you can get some knowledge on this game.You can get over twenty WWE superstars and it's free to play so download this game and enjoy.You can also upgrade your rank so you get better stuff every time you reach a certain rank.. This game is awesome and addicted, i hope the money and gold can be use for buying skin/clothes/accesories etc to make it not boring, and of course add more character, so far this game is my best game on my note 10 because simple and challenging and NOT PAY TO WIN(because it is my main reason to stop playing free android games). nWay's second attempt at a mobile fighting game is a substantial improvement over their first (Power Rangers Legacy Wars) in basically every conceivable way. There are a few bugs to work out but if Legacy Wars is anything to go by, then it will only get better with time. Highly recommended.. I love this game its fun but the bad thing is that there is input delay/lag there's but other than that the game is fun and I'm looking forward to more characters and more items to come!. I'm rating this 5 because I love this game, the graphics and all works are amazing. But there are two suggestions from me to improve the game there is a huge lack in rhoster after 2000points there are not any superstars that makes you interested to play for so make the rhoster large bring in superstars like Brock Lesnar, Goldberg, sheamus Daniel Bryan etc... Keep any chat reaction emojis or anything just to have fun with opposite player I sometimes feels like I'm playing with a bot.. I appreciate the developer n way game's that they have given this awesome WWE game that has a very good Graphics And they have tried to make it like WWE battle grounds which the moves are same as battle grounds. But only thing is that it has only one mode so I hope n way can give new update soon.. First of all I need to this game is awesome and I love it. WWE Undefeated gives the real experience of fighting in a real wrestling game with real WWE superstars. This game is really addictive with great animations and iconic moves. It also have many attractive backgrounds such the Easter Island, Pyramids etc. which gives an unique beauty to the game. After the 1.4 update the game was so great with new WWE superstars and new moves. I recommend WWE Undefeated for gamers all around the world to install this game and have real fun. You may have a great experience with WWE UNDEFEATED. So there is no problem with WWE Undefeated for me which I could not rate with 5 star. So I thank n Way Company for making such a great game. So please keep improving this game. Good Luck, Thank you.. This is the best WWE game, but there is too much of lack in the game and it is too hard to get a epic and legendary superstars, kids are so sad because they are not getting his/her favorite superstars. So, please make it easier to get every superstars and please off the lack. All though it is a great game. It's a fun game I have everyone besides braun strowman, but he was a limited time thing. It would be cool if he was brought back and if the developers brought more character each season and also I think requesting of any card would help so Purple and legendary not just blue people. But it's a great game decent graphics and also theme songs pretty accurate. It's a nice game...good graphics...so nice work by nway...but I have few problems...1- pls fix the glitch in which you choose a move but it doesn't work and that slot gets jammed leaving you with only two cards slot....2- Even when i choose a card it works after a second 3-Sometimes the entrance sound gets glitch....so please fix these glitches and your game becomes more interesting...Thank You. I love this game the wrestling moves are over dramatic but not so over dramatic to make it dumb looking the only flaw I have is that sometime my name doesn't pop up when I use certain superstars and I hope even more superstars come out like Shawn Michael's and Hulk Hogan and I know you can play with your friends I'm just not sure how to do it so if that can be explained that would be great. It is a very nice game because it don't take a lot of space and you can play it with your friends. It is very nice because at the begging all games are not having very much modes and facilities but when the game updates new things come and makes the game better than ever.", "neg_reviews": "The game's concept is really great. I've been playing it since it was released. However, with the last update, there are many bugs that ruin the experience. For example, it's impossible to find a match, the game suddenly slows down (I have a good speed Internet), and its nearly impossible to defeat macho man. He gets easily to do his finisher move. UPDATE: after the last update, the attacks cards aren't responsive, and finding a match issue is back.. Update is supposed to enhance the performance and experience. It has gone down the drain. Uninstalled the game. It was smooth before, and in fact it was the only game played by me in past couple of months. It was a go to game whenever I got some free time. But now after the update it's just a hot mess. It became laggy on the same device it ran smoothly before. It lags so much that moves don't connect, heck they don't even get selected when clicked and it's not opponents combo which is blocking.. If you're into a strategy based attack game then it's up your alley. Although, the game feels like it takes a toll on you in order to actually move up ranks. PVP is great, but I feel adding an A.I. opponent would make it a bit more simplistic to move on in the game. On a side note, the character variety is lackluster. I'm sure more will be added as time goes on, but with a thin character selection, the game feels deflated and stale.. This game is full of bots. They wait till you select an attack then either dodge it if its enough time or have a counter for it. Also you attack as they get up they can special you. You try to special when you get up and it doesn't work. Also the moves don't react when you press them if your going against a bot player. Their moves have priority over yours. After 1640 points they send bots that counter every move. This game is rigged and if you decide to play it don't put a cent towards it. The game is worst, developers need to fix the bugs and glitches , after every update the game is so lagging during battle, so many issues while fighting in battlefield, lagging, touches not responding, it was really good before but i would say this is the worst game i've ever played all because of real bugs which is very annoying. We can't even move because of lagging and touch response is so delay, taking so much time for finding matches ,. This is the worst game I have ever played. I rate it negative. No concrete logic why they have build every character in a particular way. Imbalanced characters, no concrete logic on when a used move reappears again. Bugs/lags are the creative things here that decide your win/loss. Pathetic support team who just relax by putting all on the onus on player's device. I have even cleared the search history so that I don't find this game even by mistake again.. This game is my favourite game and I really enjoyed it. But I will not give it 5 stars because I am no being able to play this game since this new update. The game is very laggy and has lots of bugs. Another game power rangers legacy wars is very good , laggless and smooth to play and for this I gave it 5 stars. Please fix the bugs of this game in this upcoming update.. This is frustrating. After last update I can not able to play a single game.Whenever I start a game, after match found I am getting kicked every time.Hopefully developer will fix it soon.. Okay, so the gameplay really sucks as soon as you find a real opponent. It lags like hell and there's so much delay. However if you play with bots, everything's gonna be fine. But if you play with a real time opponent, you're gonna have a frustrating experience especially if you're in a higher league coz even though it's not your fault, the game's gonna mess your league and your overall experience.. Good game overall but connections error most of the time even with good wifi network. Hated the fact that you can't carry on the match after being disconnected and have to wait till the match is over before able to start the game. Controls are non responsive at times and this causes quite a few matches lost. And the match up doesn't seems to make sense. Started as a newbie but was matched with someone way higher in ranking. That doesn't seems fair does it?. I love the game. But too bad it's only a PvP battle mode. So it's kinda boring after a week praying. I wish there was more battle mode like story mode, or maybe tournament mode. And some characters are too over powered, and sometimes the command buttons are so late and ruins the combos. it's sucks. (I wanted to uninstall it for sure, But the character designs and the movement effects are so good. I'm on dilemma. \ud83d\ude14). The game is a massively unbalanced, pay to win, money grab. Some bugs have remained since launch, over a year ago. There's no rhyme or reason to updates or attempts to balance. The only guarantee is that they'll churn out a new, premium character on time. That character will be far and away better than nearly everything else. This makes almost the entire roster useless, and turns the game into a never ending marathon to keep acquiring the newest, most overpowered character each month. Avoid.. Input errors aplenty. Input buttons on screen don't work most of the time. And the game demands precise timing. It's fun and easy to pick up, harder to master and be good at. Good amount of depth. But connectivity and inputs make the game frustrating. Developers need an update for it to control properly. Without proper control on a game like this its worthless. Back to one star. After many victories, the screen sticks and when the winner's results finally show up, it shows I have not gained in rank, nor earned a winner's loot case. One match even stopped midway while I was winning and declared me the loser. Feels like some players are hacking the game to win. Also please match players that are of similar rank in the leagues. Fix match making freezes, and lessen loot case opening times. Give us more characters and ways to play and earn rewards.. The game is fun, but the amount of connection issues are ridiculous. I keep getting to the next league, queueing for a match, the opponent (not me) times out before connecting, but I am somehow handed a loss. Will improve rating when server issues are fixed. Other than that, nice game so far. Edit: Server sucks worse, lag affecting move inputs, I tested my framerates and found issues. Uninstalled for lack of response.. If I could give it a zero I would. It took me all day to download it I deleted alot of my other games to make room for it and when it finally downloaded I was quite excited coz I love wrestling so much and I really wanted to play this so bad. It got half way through the loading screen then the game kept shutting down over and over so I deleted it. I'm soooo disappointed and annoyed as I was so looking forward to playing it. I am unable to play the game from the last 3 days. The game gives an error saying \"Sorry, you were unable to connect. Please try again later.\" I have tried re-installing the game and it did not help. Please fix the issue. And there are so network related errors shown inspite of having a stable internet connection. Please resolve the errors let us players enjoy the game.. This is the Best Game I usually played. But after Update its lack so much. I'm not satisfied. The Older version without update is better than the update. Wish the system will help making this game to be smooth again. Every Update or New Version has made this Game Worst because now while playing If We Win we usually get 5points. But If We Loose We Usually Lost 20points or more. I just lost 6match and my points are down by 200 which is not acceptable at All.. Its meh at best. I waited a while for this one anticipating a great game. Its a let down. For some reason, WWE always goes with these cartoon style graphics and they look horrible. Nothing revolutionary here. Let your power meter build up. Use attacks the deplete your power meter. Try to win. Mobile games seem to be at a stand still in the evolution process and this one proves just that. A big disappointment with not much replay value to offer. The tutorial was painful enough to get through.. \ud83d\udc4e , As usual all ends up for purchase. ONLINE game depends on others to join. Many times No Match Found. VICTORY ROAD longest. Abnormal sound, vibration works sometimes. Game name is Undefeated , you get defeated everytime due poor controls. Even faction donation fails and shows error. Every time purchase is required. Many times network issue at other player end and my superstar declared lose with most negative points. Some times shows positive points after loss.

I'm at level 1742. It's challenging yet easy. I don't like the addiction lol! But keep playing.\"Bubble Rainbow\" 9/22/2022 If you enjoy bubble games, this is the best. Very relaxing. ,I don't get anxious if I'm going to run out of the color I need. I earn enough points to use to get bombs, lightening, rainbows etc.... I am up to 2000's level. Good job creators.. I love this game. I am at level 3475 yes that's right. The ads for other apps is not that annoying and sadly I know all great things must come to an end eventually but until then I'm playing this game and enjoying every single second of it. Thank you. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a I just wanted to update and say thank you to the makers of this game. I just passed level 4100 and am still loving it. There are no rewards but the self satisfaction that you have accomplished something. I hope this game never ends. Thank you.. So far, it's been very good. Ads become frequent but at the moment, you're allowed to skip them after a few seconds. I hope that feature isn't taken away. Con: Fortunately I have a phone with a very good battery but this app does a number on it and drains. It's not extreme but I do notice it. I think it's due to good graphics and the new developer. They can improve the battery drain. Thank you. This is very good game . It can play during offline. It is also play by small children too.. There are no extra ads beyond what you usually experience literally anywhere on the internet. They aren't even every level. The music will cut off but as soon as you mute the ad the music starts back up on its own, I barely notice it stopping. People are being so dramatic. It's a fun, time-wasting and entertaining game. I'm on level three hundred sixty something, I think I know what I'm talking about.. Love this game, waiting on more levels !! Never get an ad, turn off wifi !! My last level is 16,696, been that way for months. Cant play this one any longer out of levels. Guess i will move on if no new levels show up soon.. I was loving this game, very relaxing I got to 1500+ level, then tried to open today and it won't open been trying all day with no luck, been on the play store and tried to open it there but no joy. The game is loading up again \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4dis there any way to change the background colour it's very dark and it's hard to see some of the darker balls...... Like all these games, it starts out easy but once it gets too hard, I will uninstall. But for now it's fun and I like the graphics. Edit update: Ok, so now I'm on level 3000 or thereabouts and still playing. Some people might think it's not challenging enough but I play too many other hard games and this one leaves me feeling pretty good about myself.. At last I've found a fast bubble shooter...the last one I had was very fast but it's no longer available so I was delighted to find this one....I hate anything slow!however as I have now completed all levels I uninstalled it and then tried to re-install but it wont go to level 1, it's way up in the 4000's..... I like this app a lot, I like it very much. This game would be great if you have a carnet with Facebook. You have connected this application to Facebook,, ((thanks)). I like it this game... Very nice and so easy.. I would have given it 5 stars... I have played over 1670 levels..... Very nice game! I am playing this game sine a year. I would recommend to play this for making your mind sharp. This is a casual game. And I am giving it 5 star. Best game ever love it! \ud83e\udd29. One thing about this game, you don't get bombarded with ads back to back. Very few ads. And not like most games that gives you a measley 200 coins after completing a level. I don't waste my time on any of those games. To me ALL Bubble Shooter games are the same, but this one has fewer ads. And that makes a difference. Great game! Fun to play with less ads.. This is the best bubble shooter game ever! It's fun, relaxing and the levels are very playable. I play this every day. The ads are short and you can get in a couple of rounds between them. I have played a lot of other bubble shooter games and you end up stuck unless you buy something. This one is not like that. Thank you for this game.. UPDATE: DISCONNECT FROM INTERNET BEFORE OPENING GAME... STOPS MOST ADVERTS. Of course you get annoying adverts but NO PURCHASES NECESSARY... TOTALLY FREE ! The actual game is EASY and FUN. I had taken Bubble Witch 3 as far as I could (Level 702 then the randomness set in). Wanting something similar, I found this. Only after a few days, I'm upto Level 470. Yes for me the game is easy, yet fun. A youngster would enjoy this. I often finish with an average of 10 shots left.. Good job on the last year i was just thinking about the games i saw this and I love it was a riddle of chemistry and that make sense of good idea what to do chill with happiness and may be able to achieve your goals. Nice, relaxed and addictive. The levels do not get too difficult as you advance (I've played over 300 levels), so you don't get frustrated.. simple, colorful and fun, challenging without being ridiculously impossible and frustrating like most of the bubble games. the ads are the least intrusive that I've found, and some of them are actually interesting.. Easy and very enjoyable. Great nerve calming game and time killer during this difficult covid time. Love the graphic and colours and the game is smooth running, no glitches or bugs so far. Ads are ok by me, dont mind them as these only come in between games. In fact i enjoy watching if they are not repeated ones. Highly recommended.. Congratulations guys. Unlike some of the other bubble popping games you have given us a nice change of pace. It is nice to enjoy a puzzle that is fun and not frustrating and just too hard for even the avid gamer. It's not too easy or too hard it is almost perfect for enjoying and unwinding. I have yet to want to throw my phone across the room. When are new levels coming. I'm at the end. Thanks", "neg_reviews": "This a fun game. Great way to expose kids to the adult versions eventually. No ads if you turn off wifi, so no accidental purchases by kids. Only ads are in game to purchase power balls which you won't really need! Great, addicting way to kill some time! 3/15/2021 Unfortunately with the new Android update you can only enter game, while online, then you can turn off wifi!! What a pain! Used to be able to enter game while offline! Thus dropping a star!. This is the 8th or 9th time I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game. I don't mind ads but when the game freezes after an ad it's frustrating. Can't this problem be solved? Now I'm up to at least 12 times uninstalled. Please fix the problem.. This is the 8th or 9th time I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game. I don't mind ads but when the game freezes after an ad it's frustrating. Can't this problem be solved?. (1) I'm dismayed. Several reviews mentioned the lack, or reduced presence, of ads, but I've been inundated with what I call \"malware ads,\" ads that won't relinquish control of my tablet. (2) The game is so slow...painfully slow. Is this because it's downloading ads in the background? IDK I'm only at level 10 and I'm already agitated and irritated.. There reaches a point where you simply can't win. The game will give you shots of colors that you can not use. Thus running you out. Then offers you \"5 more shots\" if you stop to watch a video. Then gives you 3 you can't use. I play games to relax or pass idle time. Not to be frustrated. And I don't mind losing, so long as the loss is fair. Not when a game cheats to prevent your winning. Like changing bubble color as you take the shot. Deleted. And no, dont want to chat about it privately.. Gameplay is way too easy, but my main issues are interstitial ads after every single level and worse, most of the ads are for these offensive, horribly misogynistic and rapey games where you touch and disrobe women who are tied up and portrayed as weak, submissive sex objects. It makes me not want to play at all.. Since the last update, I have been unable to start the game unless I'm connected to the Internet. I've managed to start it once by going through the app store, but that took some time. Down 4 stars to 2 stars due to this (temporary?) glitch which makes the game unplayable. **Edit - recent software update, game became playable offline again. Today (23 Mar 2021), refuses to open. Uninstalling.. Nice game, challenging and easy playing. I'm, if not the best, one of your best players, but I'm disappointed because of your try to change the balls and direction of balls, giving 10 balls, but not the colour which I need, lack of real rewards and competition. These are cheap tricks which didn't honour you and for this one *. If you want good players and fidelity, do something, as your game start to be annoying! I like the game but the adds and lack of competition will take me to...uninstall!. This game is fun to play. You get certain colors of balls to connect to the same.e other colored balls and then they pop. Its very fun to play when you're bored, and can be super easy at times. But, one big issue, is the advertisements. Usually, if you lose, you'll get offered some more time or bubbles. But, that's in return for lots and lots of advertisements. Please remove so many advertisements or make a feature to remove ads whenever you like.. It was a fun way to spend some time until the adds took up the whole page and would not close. The only way to close them was to restart my phone causing me to lose my current game. After the fourth time in a row this happened enough is enough.. This game is a lot of fun. I have a lot of difficulty getting into the game to play. I have been trying to get into the game for 45 minutes. I am up to level 400 plus I am very frustrated Can you help me or not? Every time I try to get into it it throws me out to where my apps are. Come guys fix this for me. I would be so happy to have just ONE DAY where this application didn't freeze up. With all the high end technology and the educated people y'all have working, why can't you keep it up and going? By now y'all surely have found the GLITCH that's causing the FREEZE UP multiple times a day! Just stating facts!!. Fun, but is stalling out and messing up my shots. 12.15.20 Uninstalled this. Sorry to see you go but you won't stop putting ads in during a game just at the end before my final shot and then have to restart level alllllllll over again. Bye. 5/14/21 Reinstalled hoping you fixed it. I am at level 47 and the ads are far too many. And it freezes again so I have to get out then go back in. Uninstalling again.. Rigged!!!! I play this simple to past time. It causes you to shoot where you aren't even aiming and gives you colors that aren't available. I have so many screen shots and video clips of this happening it unreal. If you're good at strategically thinking, they WILL screw you every time. They don't want you to be too good at this or use less balls then they want you to use. I'll keep the game simply because I don't have to pay and easily defeat the levels.. This game was great up until recently. There is now an ad that interrupts my game and I can't get rid of it. I have to start the game over all the time. Very annoying. I will be uninstalling this game. Violent and misogynistic Adware and not challenging at all. You could easily do over 200 levels in a day. Easy enough for young children, but you probably don't want them to be watching 95% of the ads... Which it seems the only reason for this game to exist is to serve ads, not challenge the player (even on the rate levels labeled hard). Uninstalled.. How much to remove ads? I want them gone, willing to pay.. 99 cents to get ads off. (what similar little games charge) otherwise I'll delete. Note to others: after about level 41, ads plays after every or every other match. No bueno \ud83d\ude37. This game has worked great until today. Now, if you have to watch an advertisement to complete the game...it shuts the game down. And, you have to restart that same game over. I very frustrated with the game now.. Some Bubble Shooter ad suddenly appears and locks me out of the game!!! This has happened frequently. Now two weeks later and still happening!. I had rated this a 4, but the prevalence of unclosable ads without actually having to close the game is annoying and uncalled for. While I enjoy the game, I don't appreciate having to constantly reboot it to close the ads. Sorry I will be deleting for this reason.", "pos": "Negative reviews summary:\n- Some users experience battery drain due to good graphics and new developers.\n- A few users mentioned that the game becomes unplayable after reaching the highest levels with no new levels available.\n- One user faced issues with the game not opening.\n- Some users found the background color too dark, making it hard to see certain bubbles.\n- Although ads are generally tolerable, some users mentioned experiencing frequent ads.\n- A user mentioned that the game did not reset to level 1 after reinstalling, remaining at a high level.\n- One user stated that the game may get uninstalled once it becomes too challenging.\n- A user expressed a desire for more challenging levels.\n- Some users faced issues with the game crashing or not opening.", "neg": "Users dislike the abundance of ads that interrupt gameplay, especially the uncloseable ones that require restarting the game.

The controls in battle are simple. The music in this game is the best. Years later there are new modes. Every month some old units get Zenkai Awakeings and get Zenkai abilities. This game is a great way to kill time. The pvp is also fun. The best mode is Co-op battles.You can team up with a buddy, and the featured unit does a lot of damage. To me Dragonball Legends gets a 10 out of 10.. I have been playing this game for almost 3 months, and I gotta say it's just awesome, I don't have any issues about the game though, earning lots of chrono crystals is tough but that's the challenge, that's the reason why players have to constantly play the game for earning them, so it would nice if u add some other daily event for chrono crystals just like battle gauntlet, and PvP is great, it's just I don't know how to get the best equipment of Z or Z+, overall I would play the game forever. By far one of the best addicting games I've played on mobile. Easy to play, customizable options with adjustable difficulty, loaded with different characters of all kinds to battle with, lots of events, and to top it off a long running story line to make it all the more interesting. Childhood nostalgia is complete in one big package and the best part you can take it anywhere you go to pass time. I'm looking forward to what else gets added to the game, I Highly recommend this masterpiece.. I'm a level 480+ player, and I have 2 suggestions. 1. Reduce the difficulty of Full Power Battle mode, even the normal mode is hard to do without the new character 2. Remove the 20k cc limit from exchange shop. This game is amazing, but even DBL has issues. I love it but it has so many problems. first PvP. It feels rigged because it feels like pay to win in order to get op characters. This makes it impossible to win. Second chroni crystals. Even though you get 10 once in a while doesn't make it good. It feels impossible to get new characters especially when you finished story mode. At this point I would go play Dokan since it's easier to play that. Other than that it's fun and addictive. Go play it. A very good pvp game. lots of stuff to do when not fighting. Very satisfying overall experience. Update: I still have the same opinion but be prepared to grind constantly for the character you want to obtain and for the disappointment for when you don't, multiple times. HOWEVER as I said before I still abide by my original statement, the game is still very much fun as all characters are unique in their own way. Plus it's very satisfying when you actually do get you fav character without ptw. Best DB game ever, on mobile of course. (Even though the game is good it doesn't beat console games) The game is addicting and fun. Summon animations are awesome and the fighting style of the game is just as good. If your a beginner this is the best time to hop on. The 2nd Anniversary has a ton of things that you could grind. I dont recommend the challenge rush because that could be a little too difficult. All and all there shouldnt be a problem with beginners joining now.. This game is just epic, I have no other words for it. Bandi Namco made a really good comeback by actually giving us a mobile game that has a challenging story mode and for (probably) the first time, giving you full control of the characters that you use. Just a really great game overall, it's hard for me to try to describe it without spoiling anything, though I heavily I recommend that you play.. Equipment rerolling can still be better. Maybe it's just my system's version, but tapping hardly ever works in PvP although it works everywhere else, including co-op, but not PvP. Overall though the devs really have been listening a lot to the community the past few months and I am excited for the future of Legends and there is no better time to start.. Currently i'm having a very good experience playing this game, just one change i would like to have added is that zenkai awakenings are disabled for training battle mode in pvp. I usually go there to try out new units and team comps and it gets ruined when im put up against a zenkai 7 team and considering that training battle makes all of your units 14* it makes the situation even worse. I hope you guys can make this change and if not completely, find an alternative for this.. This game is a great dragon ball mobile game. I saw some negative reviews about it and will be addressing a problem that I see sometimes. The gacha system is something to keep the game fresh and surprising. You do not need the newest and greatest units all the time unless you are competetive in pvp. You get plenty of gems, tickets, free summons, and free units from events to do literally everything else in the game that doesn't involve anything online. You do not need to spend any money.. This review has been edited by me. Couldn't fit an edit in the post. The zenkai system has been fixed entirely. Cheating does exist, but not in any excessive amount. Legends also found new ways to make content. Overall, besides wanting a couple old event formats to return (please, rising battle was amazing), the game is amazing.. I know people complain about pay to win but I've been free to play for my whole duration of playing the game. I would recommend that we teach other players how to actually create strong teams like completing story mode objectives, soul boosting and training as a main asset to being strong especially in PvP. I find it odd because I rarely struggle but I would say it's hard for me to tell the max potential of characters but other then that there's no issue with the game.. This game is very good, it is very time-consuming. And it is really difficult to play if you're a free to play player. I do advise you to make sure you complete every challenge in a mission in the main story cuz it is very hard to go back through there whenever you're at the like third part and complete all of that. It's much easier to just complete it as you go on.. This is a truly amazing game worthy of the DBZ legacy. The combat is fluent and smooth and the events are just something else. The animations is just crazy. The only one problem I have is with Shallot, regarding his class. Since he is one of the only characters you can get only in the game, and being the main character, I really think he should be upgraded to Sparking class as he deserves it. This is the only issue I have but this is a great game. I one hundred percent recommend it for download. I had originally played this game when it was in beta and had played up unti the 2nd anniversary. The game had LOTS of issues so I uninstalled however I kept tabs on it to see if the game had been improved in the areas that made it unenjoyable for me. These last few updates were the beginning of a huge turnaround. Guarenteed sparking after 5 steps! 30% sparking rates, 3x zpower drops. More of this please, and I will actually spend money. The only game I've consistently gone back to on my phone over a span of years. Absolutely love it. It receives regular updates, good multiplayer servers, excellent graphics, unique combat, and the best part is it truly can be free to play and doesn't require you to make unnecessary in app purchases to get very good characters. Amazing. The game had it's ups and downs over the years. However, with the recent leader update, Legends outdid themselves. If you love Dragon Ball and if you were ever on the fence about whether this gacha game is worth giving a shot or not, now is the best time to do so. Though there is certainly still a chance the devs mess it up in the next months (wouldn't be the first time), right now Legends is in the best state it's ever been.. Great game play, good rates for the gacha, lots of events for f2p players, tons of ways to get in all game currencies (except when you finish the story), good mostly non toxic fan base, good competitive play, and it's actually fun to play (cough cough dokkan battle cough cough). Only complaint is the constant \"connection\" thingy that happens every time you click something but the loading lasts like 2 seconds at most for me. One last thing, don't play on a potato phone.. IIt definitely improved. They give a lot of cc from PVE events so PVP is mostly played if you like the idea. Playing the game doesn't feel like a chore anymore, PVP's actually enjoyable in low - midhigh ranks.", "neg_reviews": "As a Dragon Ball fan, I love this game.

The Crystal's are too expensive for the amount they give you, servers lag during multiplayer, etc. I also wish it had a more open world feel to 7DS Grand Cross. EDIT: Dropping it down to 1 star. The developers DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY! They have completely ruined the game. It is no longer F2P, it's a Pay 2 Win game now!. Disappointed. I loved this game, but recently, there's been too many bad choices on updates. The generosity of the team has gone way down. I used to give it 5\u2606, now it's been knocked down. This game is now EXTREMELY pay to win, and there aren't enough ways for free to play players to get free crystals anymore. The way this game started was promising, but now it's just sad to see it deteriorate. Just not enough content in general. Bandai can fix this, but the ball is in their court now.. Please continue releasing new characters for Androids and other neglected character tags. Teams such as God Ki, Future, and Fusion seem to be the only teams \ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude3a receiving powerful, new characters. PvP cheating and overall imbalance is a continuing problem. The PvP imbalance issue in particular could be alleviated through a more diverse \"meta\", which would involve rejuvenating underpowered teams, as stated before. The Rival Universe tag recently saw some attention, this is great.. As of 3/16/2022,My most current review. Would give less tham 1 star if possible. Devs lock F2P event exclusive Z power behind game modes, new modes are way too difficult, even on \"easiest\" setting. Devs should either increase pull rates or give out more chrono chrystals for less $ because new units are defacto mandatory especially for full power battle mode. F2P Players might as well delete the game or not even start playing. Save your time and $.. I'm dropping my initial four star rating, nearly every time I summon the game crashes. What's the point of playing a game when its prized mechanic barely works? Not only that, but there's no way to get the wasted chrono crystals back, without playing the story mode for hours, or spending money that is. Better off holding onto your chrono crystals until the game's fixed. Don't get me wrong, I love the game. And I am willing to wait for a fix, it's just frustrating how janky the summons are.. Not great. I used to think it was an alright game, but its really not. You'll be disappointed by all the units you don't pull out of summons. PvP isn't fun, most of the time, you're either getting matches with people that are 10x your skill level or people having very high star characters/Zenkais(best cards in game), while you have 2-3 stars max The game is basically P2W. It's hard to enjoy the game when you can't even win with characters you like playing with because they aren't \"meta\". Greed disguised as Dragon Ball. This app truly is a gold-plated turd. Everything looks good, but plays terribly. You obtain characters randomly, in a slot machine style draw. Acquiring any decent new character is nearly impossible due to terrible drop rates and a free-to-play punishing algorithm. The sad part is, I love all things Dragon Ball, and I have spent some money on this game and can't complete new events for lack of bonus characters. Pvp is impossible, due to exploitable glitches. Trash. After the recent updates my gameplay is worsening! There's too much lag during PvP ranking!! I am in a losing streak! When I use my arts skill, it will the used 2-3 seconds after pressing and the opponent uses vanishing step and kill me! I use wifi so there's no way my internet is fluctuating!! Fix this! It's very annoying and makes me want to throw/destroy my phone!. I came to enjoy the game for a good while, but as of now it's become frustrating and boring. Events are recycled without more cystals to collect, adventures are boring and offer rewards that are worse than before, and the new banners aren't worth the investment with its new set-up, as well as the zenkai system rendering new banners irrelevant. Pvp would be more enjoyable if it was balanced, but as of right now it's an irritating chore. I'll be keeping away from this game until it's fixed.. New update shows that you guys have absolutely 0 clue on how to balance things. Everybody is struggling on full power mode but whales. Even people playing since the start of the game are struggling, and not in a good way either. The meter to break the boss's ultimate burst attack or whatever the hell you guys call it is absolutely broke. Each time it initiates, it gets harder to break (as if it wasnt already hard enough the first time). Listen to your players for once and balance the game. Used to be 5 star, but requiring us to pay for basic improvements that the game has needed since day 1, as well as reducing rates, making it harder to earn CC, constant awful \"Step Up\" events designed to drain money, rewards shops still offering outdated characters, wanting us to pay for the background music, and everything else I don't have the patience to type, they are ruining what could have been one of the best mobile games out there. Good game but don't spend any money on the gems or equipment. After you upgraded your characters to \"Max\". You will still lose to the people at \"PVP\". You will run into those cheaters 90% of the time. They could kill you in couple blows and you couldnt damage them at all. There is no way to report those cheaters to the developer. Good luck and don't smash your devices!!!. I had started playing again since the Developers said they were starting to listen to player feedback. I am not sure what they chose to listen to but not a lot seems to have changed. Free Zenkai Awakenings is good but it should have always been free. But the reason I am uninstalling again is the 20,000 Chrono Crystal soft cap. There is no reason to stop players earning and saving as much as they want. This feels like a dirty tactic to force players to spend them when they may not want to.. dragonball legends is addicting for sure, but, it gets harder to get free chrono crystals every single day. There are events to get those chrono crystals and for free, but, when you release like 4 banners a month thos chrono crystals will be gone so quick and there are no reliable ways to get most of them back. PVP is also a mess and lags every single time you play it. The system doesnt recognize cheaters, bots and other things when we play and it just makes it so frustrating.. Played it for a while with little to no issues, besides the occasional crash but it was rare. Suddenly, not long before the update, my game has been crashing constantly. I can't play co-op or it crashes, playing PVE makes it crash, summons make it crash, I can't play the new game modes because while setting my team up it crashes everytime. Because of this, I can't even get the daily challenges done, it's been happening for a while, would be great if it was fixed so I could enjoy rhe new update.. Haven't re-download the game but seriously, how bad can these devs be if they can't fix major crashing issues. These have been happening for months and it STILL happens all the time from what I read on other reviews. Maybe focus on making the game playable first so people can actually enjoy it, then I'll give it a higher rating.. The base game is fine. But the problem is that PVP mode is busted due to the large amount of damage modders and cheaters that use lag as a battle tactic. It's a waste of time especially because it's a problem that is years old and the developer does absolutely nothing about it these days. So do not bother spending money on this app. You often see cheaters using 2-3 star characters with low rank equipment somehow besting your 7+ characters with S-rank equipment. The cheating is that bad.. I have been playing this game from past 2 years and the game was really good. But after the update of 2nd Anniversary I'm really disappointed. The gaming experience is getting worst as it is becoming unfair in many aspects. As the developers are working on new update they are ignoring many small issue. After getting frustrated I finally give up on the game.. The game is total trash. The rating matches lag a lot. Many times the opponent abuses the lag and uses vanishing step in the middle of your attack. Characters are unbalanced as hell. Its hard to get stars on limiting on legends. The story is generic and nothing special. The grinding is boring. Just spam skip tickets for grinding the element crystals. Game is just a waste of space on playstore. Just remove this garbage and dump it in the trashcan. Uninstall this game, it's not worth your time.\ud83e\udd72. Was excited for the Festival but now disappointed again. Apparently 24K cc isn't enough. Are any really fair summons? I've been playing a ton to save up for the banners, but the same characters are pulled all the time. Pull rate has been worse than other banners, I mean what's the point of the 3x z power if I only get the same 3 characters? I'm just really exhausted of all the grinding for cc without fair rewards. This has become a lot more stressful than fun. \ud83d\ude15 Not worth the time for F2P.", "pos": "Negative reviews for DRAGON BALL LEGENDS focus on the following aspects:\n- Difficulty in acquiring Chrono Crystals, making it challenging for players to obtain new characters and progress in the game.\n- Perceived pay-to-win elements in PvP battles, where having powerful characters obtained through in-app purchases seems necessary for success.\n- Complaints about the gacha system, with some players finding it frustrating despite the game providing various ways to earn in-game currency.\n- Time-consuming nature of the game, especially for free-to-play players who may struggle to keep up with the content.\n- Frustration with the Zenkai Awakening system in PvP battles, impacting the overall game experience.\n- Connectivity issues during gameplay, although the loading times are generally short.\n\n", "neg": "Users dislike the expensive Crystals, lag during multiplayer, and the shift towards a Pay 2 Win model.

Terrific graphics for bingo!!! Really love the tourneys! I really love all the free tickets! And, it is worth any money that I spend here! My family and I love this game, super fun game! Cannot get thru my day without it! I6t's a great way to spend many fun hours!!!!! And, thank you all so very much, you guys rock!!!!!! And, they fix any problems that may occur asa possible!! : ). The app is so annoying. I cannot play because it can't connect to the internet. Seriously, you keep on updating, but your updates is still suck! I purchased an expensive bundle in able to play this game, yet the ticket and power ups didn't reflect in my account. Unacceptable! ticket bundles, power ups and barrels are too expensive, and quantity are too small. Puzzle pieces are hard to collect. And also customer service doesn't reply.. Addictingly fun! Lots of freebies, and side games going on. Great Tournament style competition. I have noticed many times it is near impossible to win the puzzles. I use to at least get close, and felt like buying extra chips, and I had a chance. As of late, i am sitting around 2 or 3 winning pieces out of 20. Also i noticed you have shortened the time between end of tournament, and the end of puzzle game, which makes it even more difficult to win.. I love bingo showdown. The only downside in my opinion, is that as you progress through the levels the rewards don't increase. I feel like the rewards value should reflect the levels difficulty. I also, wish there were more ways to gain tickets and powerups. All in all this is a great gamek and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys bingo and wants something really fun to pass their time!. It is advisable to buy tix and power ups if you want to be competitive. The app has9 more things going on than one might think but it remains a challenge afters two years. C'mon... Still daubing pardner! still here. still here. still adding new features, still here, still good. Still a good app after a few years. And another year. And another year? And another year And another year. The Gizmos challenge is awesome. I really like how the level rewards are more evenly distributed, giving more chances for prizes at all levels of the game.. I have played this bingo showdown game for many years. It is the most enjoyable bingo game ever. I would advise Everyone who loves playing bingo to get this game. You will Not play any other bingo once you have played bingo Showdown. My misfortune is that I can't play this game at this time because I have lost it and don't know how to get it back. I definitely enjoyed all the many get free item. The most enjoyable bingo game get it.. I don't play any other games. Been playing this game for years and it never gets boring. Good game. I do wish we could zoom or even flip phone so I could see numbers better. I'd play more often. I give it a 5 Star bc its a fun challenging game when trying to out do the score boards and win 1st Bingo without, all the shouting..lol.. between trying to get a Bingo, you've added puzzle piece contests, bonus point accumulation add ons, with a CHOICE of how much tickets to use to get those points, and other bonus games. Graphics are well designed, game play easy, and I never get bored.\ud83d\ude01. I love this game! Unlike other games, you don't have to spend a bunch of money to keep playing after the first week. They give out free tickets/power ups on their fb page, which allows you to restock tickets. If you don't mind buying tokens, they always have a decent deal going on too! There are multiple ways to earn tokens too. All you have to do is keep playing the game and your progress earns more tokens, unlike others that makes you play mini games to earn more. Also ad free! Worth a try!. I love this game. I can play for hours. The new update is awesome....Best bingo game ever. Awesome full of exciting tasks to earn rewards that help you keep playing for hours. Fun Fun Fun....Great fun for the whole family. My 9 yr old granddaughter can even play. Spectacular game. Spectacular game. But caller goes really fast at times. Love this game...My whole family plays it. I just love the new challenges no other game offers so many ways to earn tickets and power ups. This bingo game is super fun but you don't get to pick what power ups you play and that's annoying. So you end up spending more money cause they use the good ones right away. It's kinda frustrating. And you don't get to pick what power ups you want to buy so that's even more frustrating and the game goes super fast and they don't call good numbers or numbers that you need barley ever. It's kinda annoying. Probably gonna uninstall real soon..!!. Awesomeness! Great Game and Fun! But it runs out of time too fast and all my numbers don't be checked. Can you all stop running out the time so fast on us and using up all of our good power resources and replace them. We can't bingo well and get ahead if you keep doing that and you all causes me lose out on bingo's because you run out the time too fast. Even though it's still fun and the new features are cuter, you all need to stop cheating us out of our stuff. I need more wins than losses.. Very addictive game. Nice way of relaxing. Need to get more bingo and bingo pieces. Why is it so hard to win a bingo for the puzzle pieces? It is too hard to win the barrels. Still too hard to win the puzzler. Question, if u split the puzzle half and half, and u find 10 pieces, don't you get some rewards for that? Why is it still so hard to win the puzzle pieces, or even the puzzle itself as a matter of fact? Love the game. It's an average game. Except it doesn't seem like I get as many bingos as I did when I 1st started playing. A d if you wanna play for a little bit then you'll need to buy power ups and tickets!! Thats the only part of all of these games that's getting me upset is that if you play ur gonna have to pay!+. Getting better keep up the good work. Still haven't gotten any bad guys since I started this game. Could use a few more powerups.. I really like this game alot. Maybe you can add more boards?. one of fav games!! its fast, fun and i love it! just wish it didnt cost so many tickets! I have so much fun!## love it..you should give more tickets when u open a chest and level up..the games cost a lot of tickets for those of us that like 4 cards!!- thank u for everything..rgreat game!!. I have enjoyed playing this bingo for months. One of the best bingo apps you can get. Even if you don't have a lot of money to put in to it they offer up enough free tickets to keep you playing and interested. I also like all the side games that this app has giving you plenty of opportunity to win tickets and power ups and make the game more fun. The game play flows wonderfully and hardly ever freezes or crashes. Great app, good job to the developers. Nice work people. Best bingo app I've played. This has been a wonderful game to play. One thing I would recommend is increasing the payouts from the tournaments, particularly for those who end up finishing in the wood or stone ranks. I feel that the payouts are just a little small. Otherwise overall great game.", "neg_reviews": "I had three puzzles pieces to go!!! But u guys made sure it was impossible to win them!!!!! Why am i not surprized!!!!!!. The game keeps stealing my tickets.. At this time you owe 18. I would like them returned to me . My user number is 505903.. I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone!!! Its rigged for you to lose and spend money on it!!! Theyve fixed it to where its worse than ever!! Harder to get puzzle pieces,youll lose power ups and waste them trying to win. They call the same numbers for every tournament. They change up the order but call the same numbers, so after 2 games you can see how screwed your gonna get for the rest of the tournament!!! Pay attention and delete thus game. Its a rip off, fixed, theyve tweeked it for worse. Best bingo game around. Just one thing. Should give tickets for bingos. Every other game does still waiting for tickets for bingos \ud83d\ude01. Great fun but not enough rewards. Start rewarding players. Games are all messed up since the upgrade. Not being able to get ahead when you get bronze is a joke. I'm getting very annoyed with this game and seriously thinking of deleting unless you guys sit up and take notice. Sort your game out!!!!. DO NOT PLAY UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND CASH DAILY! 4.7 star rating still? With all the dropped ratings? Dropping again to 1 star. Really used to be a fun and exciting game, but they have gotten too greedy for my pocketbook. I used to be able to make $25 last for at least a week. Now, $50 doesn't even last a day. They tell me I've just had a run of bad luck... Really? Finally resolved myself to only winning 125 tickets per day (costs me 20 tickets per game), so I cannot play very long.. Players Beware- since upgrade, fewer numbers hit, requiring longer play and use of powerups- so not worth effort in capturing outlaw unless willing to chance using precious powerups. Play still frustrating, so playing less now. this game has become very sorry. I used to love playing this game every day, but it seems like lately I've been having nothing but problems. The game be cheating, it don't give you your bingos when you press the bingo button and it counts down and closes the game without give me your bingo. And then it don't want to give you your power-ups either I would never spend another dime on this game again.. I've been playing this game for like 3 4 5 years and I don't know what the heck's going on here but lately when I'm playing it's not giving me my barrels it's not giving me my bingos it won't let me hit the bingo button and take my bingo it's become a real piece of s*** what the f*** is going on??i find the more I play the worse the game is \ud83d\ude11 it's always ripping me off in pionts and everything it has to offer!?. I don't recomed it.\ud83d\ude23 it's frustrating.. If I could right now I wouldn't give it even 1 star!! With each new update the s screen gets smaller and smaller. I can't tell what some of the rewards are. Also, they take away a reward or perk each time. The game goes backwards and takes away perks for players instead of adding or at least staying the same. It has become disappointing.. Needs work, and for the money you spend they make it super hard to get tickets or power ups any other way then to buy them consistantly.The only way to even get a bingo most ever is to have plenty of power ups.They really need to make it a little easier then what they do then to have the only goal being to make sure they make plenty of money.Im done for sure without some changes.. So i can take down 5 star rating they paid me for. Not worth the download. Every aspect of the game is pretty much unplayable without dumping a bunch of money in microtransactions. You cannot win whatsoever or even marginally compete without paying for it. Why bother? So editing this after i uninstalled the game. I have tried as both a free player and paid and realize the entire model of the game forces you into microtransactions. You literally cannot advance without buying something. #shameful. This game is terrible.. you cannot control the call speed...and when you finally get a bingo it won't give enough time to mark it before ending the session...so I deleated it. This game was much more fun before you added all those supposed 'updates' which just keep making it worse. Very few bingos. I play 2 cards, and most of the time my scores are less than 25%. Puzzle pieces are almost impossible to get. It's been over 2 months since I got a reward. They almost always cut the game off before you can daub the last number. The last update changed the daily reward game, and not for the better. I'm really disappointed.. \"CAVEAT EMPTOR\". Among other the worst games because of their exorbitant 'in-app purchase' fees. BIG RIP-OFF! Instructions for icons leave a lot to be desired. After 7+ hours of playing (not at one sitting) I still didn't know what some of them were for. Constant pop-ups to purchase. Annoying. Free incentives are embarrassingly little. During my play I had to spend over $20 just to keep playing. If you are anything but a master game player or have money to burn DO NOT get involved.. The developers continued incompetence with their updates of this game simply defy belief. Latest android version now contains all the same bugs and idiosyncrasies of the FB version plus a whole host of new ones - constant connection issues, not loading past start up screens, games that freeze and then suddenly end without calling a single number, taking my tickets with it. Deserves 0 stars but forced to give it 1 so I can write this. Used to be a favourite game but now it's just an irritation!. Been playing this game a long time, don't even know why I keep playing, if you have No Bonuses you Stumped, Too Few Tickets means no completion of Tournaments and Puzzles in Time, such a shame, as I collect tickets and bonuses now for a few days from fan page but they far and few inbetween, love this game always have, collect and send 25 to FB Friends doesn't help much as you sending as well... Please improve The Ticket Collection Time Would Be Such a Pleasure to keep us in the game.. Not a fun game. Pretty much rigged so the odds of you getting a bingo are slim to none. Been playing for days. Can count on 1 hand the number of times I've been allowed to score a bingo (3). There aren't enough bingos to go around. A round lasts like 45 seconds, and over 100 bingos will be gone before you have a few daubs. Clearly not good odds. Not any fun.. Really enjoy the game. Would have given it 5 stars but still a few things I think could be better. It's like anything basically, you get what you pay for. I still don't think they give enough of tickets or other items for as hard as it is to win things. I detest that random spin game with a mini play especially when it stops on whammy. What a waste of time Seems like it changed for the worse just like 2 days ago. The more you bid the less you win... I cannot afford it...The credits go 2 fast. Yet another highly rigged (not random) SciPlay owned game. Just like their slot games, you get tons of Bingo's and let you have fun for a bit. Right around level 55-60 all that comes to an abrupt stop. They dance around your numbers, throwing bones here and there, and you watch the number of Bingo's fly by. The game grants you one sparingly as to keep you locked in, and to spend for more tickets. Prizes are b.s. as well and too low. RIGGED!!!. if i could give you a 0, i would. This game is rigged so you have to spend real money to even advance anywhere. The game is supposed to be fun, but it gets boring when you play more than 50 games and not one Bingo. And without those bingoes, you don't progress in the tournaments. Unless you have a stockpile of money to throw away, don't download this game. It is literally a money trap and not very fun when you can't even win at least once.

I would recommend it to everyone who is a student because u can record the online sessions and in ur exams u can listen to it. So it's pretty easy to use and pretty helpful... But the only problem is that u can not send the full video... Pl fix out this problem... Still I'm giving it 5 stars because it's very helpful for me.... I dont use this for gaming. I use it for recording anything I want and also voiceovers. I use this app every single day. Absolutely amazing! No glitches. No weirdness. Nothing. Reliable and amazing. Thank you to the Developers for making this! I love it! Thank you! Much love and many blessings to you. Check me out on YouTube.... Sara Saving Spirits. \ud83e\udd70. I love this app! This app is very good for taking screen shots, How ever apart from it being very good, It lags. Some times when I want to take a screen shot, the button disappears and won't let me take screen shots! Please, Please! Fix this. Apart from that, Awesome app!. I am honestly blown away with my experience with this app. Amazing app would recommend. It is so helpful and is completely out of the way when using my phone. Causes no issues or lagging when recording and the audio and the video are absolutely perfect. Ads are short and not very often (a small price to pay). Thanks a lot for this app, keep it free.. I really love this app, not like other screen recorder this is the best app I've ever tried, I get high fps when playing games using this screen recorder and almost did not notice any lag. Not just that , this screen recorder have so many free features like \"costumize floating ball\" and a trash can if you accidentally deleted the video you want to save. Really recommend this screen recorder!!! (Sorry for bad english). Very nice app .....It's a amazing app but if we can share this apps video's on any app so that video will be looking very blur but if there will coming new update so this will make its amazing there will be newest many features like crop video,filter, sticker , text and also of the photos sticker and many other thing so it's amazing app ....................... The Screen Recorder-XRecorder is one of the best recorder for recording screen and even livestreaming. Special thanks to the developers of Screen Recorder-XRecorder. I have spent a very good time with this. It's my favourite app. It is the best app in my experience. I hope the developers will update the app soon. Best wishes for the xrecorder developers.. It's really easy to use! I dont have microphone on my normal screen record, And this really helped alot!! \u263a\ufe0f I know there has been lots of bugs or wrong stuff with some ppl downloading this, But for me, This works so perfectly fine! Although, It's hard to make a screen record edit bcuz you can see the orange rec, But that's fine! It has no bugs, Some different phone types dont have the pause feature on the normal screen rec, Like me! This would really help you, Well thx for the hard work! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude01. Great app. Easy to use and very useful. I intend to use this app to capture alert video from my INDOOR security camera. I dont need to buy cloud storage, which needs monthly payment. Just stream live-view when being alerted and screen-record it. Not very efficient but it works and you only need to record certain events, not the whole day. But if you need to record the whole day, it's a different story. This saves me money not needing to buy cloud storage.. This app has been really good for my videos on mobile. Sadly 1080p doesn't work with my phone but that is ok. Thank you really much for making this app! It's really good and has mic controls, internal audio controls, and more! Works very well. Really recommend using this for your phone. This is the end of my review. Bye.. An amazing app, I highly recommend! Some of the other recording apps I've used like DURECORDER or Vidma always delete the notification bar for no reason when I press record, and you have to be in the app to get it back. In XRecorder you can just click the app and it does not take you in the app. It just gives you the notification bar and widget immediately. And there are no things about editing in this review because I edit with capcut. So there are no other things I need to explain. Nice job:). Very good app!! I would rate this app 5 stars because first of all the sound quality is amazing...second thing is that I liked the clarity of ths video I made it was literally so clear everything was spotlessly visible so I liked that alot then I think the third thing is that the drawing feature is too amazing although I don't use it generally but still it is all quite amazing...app 5 stars....\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50. Amazing app. Does everything just as described. Couldn't ask for smoother running . only complaint would be app crashing consistently, or and I'm not sure how magically after recording a video of a hour or so when going to review the video it either has 1. Said it's been modified shortly after filming not sure how that is possible when I never touched it.,2. Needed to be repaired even tho filming had been done finished no problem and also watched without any glitches. This is a very easy for use and no ads in it so i recomend to you this screen recorder for records your any games movie screen record and any kind of video and best for Youtubers.. By far the BEST app I've ever used as a moterola android user. Now it's a bit different for me because I used to use an iphone but switched out of it very quickly. And when I searched screen record in play store I found this and new that it would be THE ONE! It allows me to use my voice. It also allows me to record the in-game audio and captures everything. It's similar to apple recording but in my opinion. It's better because the screen recorder has a pause button and screen shot easily there.. Thanks for noticing:> I'm sorry for blaming this app omg, it was actually my phone's problem\ud83d\ude2d I'm really sorry:\\. This is actually good and quality is sooooo goodd this is better than my phone screen recorder-_- keep it up:>. It is a very excellent screen recording app and for editing because after update it is very editer option has came for this reason I had given this 5 stars and for me I am telling it is most beautiful editing and screen recording app in the world, I know that 'V Recorder' app is also famous because it has most experience but I using still now for editing and recording for this app. But please update new option also. Thank you, yours affectionately. From 'P_Roy_Gamer'.. Special many many thanks to the developers of Screen Recorder-X recorder. I have spent a very good time with this. It's my favourite app. It is the best app in my experience. I have ever seen a good app like Screen Recorder-X recorder. I hope the developers will update the app soon. Best wishes for the xrecorder developers.. This app is really great. I like that you have access to everything. I bought this app to experiment with recording the internal audio and microphone at the same time. It does this, but the internal audio is always too loud, even after I changed the settings in the app. I think that if the developers could setup up the internal audio and mic audio to be recorded as two SEPARATE audio files simultaneously, that this app would change the game for recording and streaming on android.. It's an excellent app for recording your screen so I recommend you all to install this app. But there is one problem that if your net is open then it will show too much ads. Otherwise it's a good app. So I request to the developers of this app not to show so much ads.", "neg_reviews": "Too many ads. Most seem to be full screen that interupts work flow. There is one in particular that trys to get you to install a memory cleaning app. I would never install an app that i did not first review it. To sum it up, too many ads, espically full screen. Some ads appear to be part of the app, but in fact are links to instsll other unknown apps. Tricky, Tricky. If this was a restraunt, the kitchen would be filthy and the rats are in charge. I uninstalled. Will look for another.. This app has to many bugs. I already gave permission for the app to use audio and yet it still turns it off in my setting by itself. It's like every time I dont't use it for a while, I have to allow it AGAIN to use audio. This is getting very annoying and that needs to be fixed ASAP.

I am so disappointed because there is so much lag, my stuff stops recording when I'm not pressing anything, the audio is so bad, and there is to much ads. I loved this app at first but now it gotmto the point where I have to uninstall this and hive a bad review. I hope you guys fix this. All of the reviews look great but I give this a 1 star.

I loved this app at first but now it gotmto the point where I have to uninstall this and hive a bad review. I hope you guys fix this. The video quality is terrible.You can hear all the noise you make, for example lets say your sister is watching TV or your mom is cleaning or whatever you hear every word and sound in the screen recording. It is nothing like an IPhone screen recording wich is one of the only things I liked about my IPhone. And also you can hear the static in the videos and it's ear rape! My goodness never using this app again!. No live stream and if you look at the comments it's all the same thing copy and paste just change a detail. Made to look like du screen recorder. And does not do live streams. The logo and the app are basically Du screen recorder. DO NOT DOWNLOAD! Download the real du screen recorder not a basic copy!. There are too many ads and almost no space once I record something. The amount of time recording is limited; I can record for only 35 minutes, and then if I need to record something else, I'll have to delete other videos. Also, it records the background noise too! Which is VERY annoying and when you actually try to watch the video in peace, the background noise screeches, and hurts my ears. Not the best app to use.. Used to be a great app. Great editing, recorded well. Now its rubbish. I try to record something, and the pop-up goes away in mid-recording and i have to record again. I attempted a record part of a video over 10 times before finally giving up. Definitely do not recommend.. I installed this app, paid Rs 500 and switched to x-recorder pro for better experience from the app. But to my dismay I found that the recording stops abruptly. This problem has happened several times. I updated the app but still the problem persists. I mailed them stating my problem, 24 hrs passed, I did not get any reply. Worst experience. It keeps crashing now after rhe update i will turn it on to record and it crashes and shuts down and says error intrup my game and causing it to close idk what has happaned to this app but i never had a issuw till now. I do not have problems with my phone or games till i start using this app..it lags crashes errors out ugh i need to finish ny youtubr video and i csnt.. Sadly when trying to record a video with this app for a game on my phone, the audio playback comparative to the video is massively out of sync by a good 5 seconds or so. I've tinkered with everything from framerate to quality and in-between to no avail. I'm just using the MD.emu emulator to play a Sega Megadrive game so certainly nothing taxing on my CPU. Tried updating, reinstalling etc. I can't really rate this until the issue is fixed or a team member contacts me with a way to fix it.. I change my mind on this, if I screen record, the audio is trash, dont recomend to make videos with.. Not good app... I actually have problem recording and why does it says \"Opps! THERE IS A NETWORK issue check your Internet\". Agian and agian it shows the same and the screen won't record. When it does record everything's sounds like brrrrrrrrrrrrrr in the videos and my fans cannot hear my voice. So emberassing\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33. Geez. Pls fix it.. Doesn't record audio, only your microphone. Misleading information on app page. Edit: the reason for the 1 star rating is because the app description says \"with audio\" which implies it records device audio, not the microphone. Cheap trick to try to get more downloads among all the other screen recorder clones that are built using what seems like an open source screen recorder plugin, considering they are all so similar.. I was trying to record a mixtape that I was making but this app was creating glitches throughout. How do I know it was this app? It only happened whenever I was trying to record my screen. Once i played it back, i kept hearing static in the background and the glitches throughout the recording. Gave 2 stars because it was quite easy to use compared to a few I've tried.. This Is the worst Screen Recording Ever! The reason I say this is because whenever I want to play a game and screen record it doesnt record it just dissapppers right after I have just been in the game for a couple of minutes! Not too mention when U want to hear music while recording although it might not appear in the recording but it just stops along with my music during my game. Fix this issue or at least help me figure out what I can do to prevent it from getting crashed. I used this app before, the recording and graphics are great but it isnt recording ANY INTERNAL SOUND. I had my volume up and change the settings to make it record internal sound but it ISNT WORKING. This app would get a better rating if it worked better.. This app used to be wonderful. But they added a pro-subscripion. All non-subscripitiom videos have a watermark on them now. They also flooded the app with adds. I thought this app had integrity. I guess I was wrong. I had to change my 5 star review to 1 star.. My go to recorder. But... The recent update to include recycle bin is extremely annoying because I've to delete everything twice. Before the update I used to delete from the popup right after recording ends. Now I'm forced to go into the app everytime and choose recycle bin and delete, wasting time; convenience is lost. I would recommend the Devs to make recycle bin optional in settings which will be great for many people.", "pos": "Negative reviews summarized:\n- Difficulty in sharing full videos.\n- Lagging issue when taking screenshots.\n- Some users experienced glitches and issues with the pause feature.\n- App crashing consistently.\n- Some users faced issues with the internal audio being too loud.\n- Excessive ads when the internet is open.\n- Request to developers to reduce the number of ads.\n- Need for separate audio files for internal audio and microphone recordings.\n- Desire for updates to improve app performance and features.", "neg": "Negative reviews highlight the following key issues with the Screen Recorder - XRecorder app: \n1. **Too many ads**: Full-screen ads interrupt workflow, some of which try to trick users into installing other unknown apps.\n2. **Bugs**: Audio permissions reset automatically, requiring users to repeatedly grant access. \n3. **Lag and recording issues**: Users experience lag, recordings stop randomly, poor audio quality with background noise, and sync issues between audio and video.\n4. **Limited recording time**: Users can only record for a maximum of 35 minutes, leading to the need to delete previous recordings to make space for new ones.\n5. **Pro subscription and watermark**: Non-subscription videos now have watermarks, and the app has been", "summary": "-", "features": "-", "adjectives": "-", "search_term": "-"}, "com.playgendary.tom": {"app_name": "Tomb of the Mask", "description": "Tomb of the Mask is an arcade game with an infinite procedurally generated vertical labyrinth.

That may just be on android though?! only issue is I've gotten to level 200 and waiting for the new levels to be made haha! even when you run out of lives you can play the arcade version which is super fun too! :) would recommend!. I really like the game. TotM is a really fun and addictive game. I do admit, it can be quite a rage game at times bit if you lose your energy then just go to the arcade mode to practice whilst you wait! A friend showed me this game and I liked the look of it so I got it. (This bit's for the creator) I love the art style of the game and the animation is very slick and clean. Overall it's an excellent game and I would definitely recommend it.. As a whole, I love this game. I love the retro pixel graphics and the sound design. I love the general aesthetic of the game as a whole. The enemies are well designed, and the gameplay--while simple--is tight and very responsive. It's very easy for me to sink time into this game and not realize it. The quantity of ads is more than I like but because it's such a nicely built game, I want $ to go to the devs so I watch some of the ads. Overall, worthy of 5/5 stars. Good job. \ud83d\udc4c. Tomb of the Mask is an amazing, addicting, and somewhat frustrating game. I downloaded it while searching Google Play for \"Arcade\" games, but ran into an issue. I haven't even started recording yet I'm at level 70. It's addicting and it tests you at times. You have to learn to be patient, because timing is everything on some levels. Other levels you have to move fast. I highly recommend this game to others if you're looking for something fun yet challenging to pass the time. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50. This game is really fun. Its about a little yellow square collecting dots. There's traps though. I am at stage 107. This game is so much fun. Some things I would like you to fix, when you use the shield, and you use it on the blue wall trap, it doesn't do anything. I was thinking to remove it once you use the shield, or died from that and revive. But otherwise than that, Tomb Of The Mask is soooo much fun. I played it every day!! Thamk you for creating this game!!!!. Loved it. I love the style and level design, the levels are unique and fun to play, and the different mechanics and obstacles makes it very challenging. The only \"bad\" thing that i found on this game is the lack of energies you have, and the fact that you have to wait to get ONE back; i get it that thats supposed to make the game more challenging, but its kinda annoying having to watch an ad or wait 30 min to get one energy back. Besides that, this is a very fun game and i totally reccomend it!. Great game!!! Really cool and it is a little bit like pacman, but without the ghosts. Very little ads, so it does not frustrate me as some other games do. Also the easiness of the game is also right for whichever level you are on, and it's very creative!! Definitely worth your time downloading. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. Great game! I've played this game for awhile and enjoy it! However, now that I've beaten all 350 levels with 3 stars and getting all dots in each level, I'm a bit saddened. Can't wait for more levels to come. Also suggesting new traps and monsters to be added in both maps and arcade, more types of secret bonus areas in Arcade, more masks and higher level bonus past 20. A new third mode would be cool too, maybe like a combination of arcade and maps, where you go through random maps til dying.. tomb of the mask is really fun! its kind of like pac man, but as you go through the levels there are more and more distractions and challenges. one thing i dont like is that you have five energy every day unless you buy them for in game coins. i guess theyre cheap but they get more expensive each time you buy. and when you fail a level, you lose an energy. other than that, this is a very fun game!. Honestly one of my favorites, a good game if you are bored and don't mind ads. It looks like a old 8 or 16 bit, with the same music, so if you like retro games, this ones for you. No money required, if you want to block ads, you can pay around 3 bucks, and you can watch ads for lives and other helpful stuff... Overall a brilliant game, well worth whatever time they, and possibly you... put into it.. This game is great. I love it so much that I paid the $3 to remove ads. However, the one bad thing I have to say about this game is bad enough to take it down from a 5 star to a 2 for me. Every screen except the gameplay screen is a money making strategy, and it just seems like the developer's only goal is to profit. Even the respawn screen has a button to watch an ad to open a chest, which makes absolutely no sense based on gameplay. A chest has nothing to do with helping you try again.. So........ I've reached the end of the line. There are 350 levels currently, and I've played them all, perfectly. I love this game, but I was also wandering when the developers are gonna add more levels. Other than that, it's a really fun, and honestly addictive game. I don't keep games on my phone long, but I've definitely had this one the longest!. Awesome game. It's really fun to play, and the premium options aren't necessary at all to enjoy most features. The arcade mode can be played any time, but the energy for the lap levels recharge pretty fast. As for the ads, yeah they're a bit frequent but it only costs 1.99 to upgrade to ad-free, and you can also just play in airplane mode to avoid them. Keeps me occupied and the art is great!. I enjoyed the beginning of it. but like any other puzzle games, it sadly ends. 350 levels, that's all it takes to finish this game, and you will not like it since somewhere level 200, there are no more new things to introduce. In the end, I love it. It's just sad because I'm pretty sure you can add more gimmicks, like door switches, boss battles... well, the game doesn't have a plot in the first place,. so there's that. I enjoyed the journey, kinda.. I.LOVE.THIS.GAME it's a simple concept but entertaining to play. Whenever I'm in the car for a few hours, I play some music and then go strait to this game. I love that the developers added the arcade section, you can play arcade when waiting for the energy to refill or as I like to do, once you've finished all the levels and waiting for more. Even though I've competed all the levels, I find myself going back and replaying the precious levels.. OK, look: This is one of very few modern mobile games that is actually worth trying. Yes, there's lots of ads, but those can be easily removed without any kinds of mods. Playgendary, I have one request for this game: Switch port. It would feel right at home on the Switch, seeing as it has a touch screen, and could also use the sticks or d-pad. $5 on the eShop and I could see it being pretty popular.. This is now my favorite game. It is an entertaining, adrenaline rushing, adventures game. It can also function without the usage of data or Wi-Fi and therefore is a great game to play during a rode trip. This game has many levels and the obstacles get harder every level, making every game a challenge, witch I love. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves an adventure.. This first game(Tomb of the Mask) and the second game(Tomb of the Mask: Color)are SIMILAR, but they aren't THAT similar. The similarities between these two games is, that they have the same TRAVELBOY character. Both of the games have a lot of coins. They both also have the same obstacles and dangerous stuff. But there are differences between these two games. The first game has a spinning wheel, stars, shields, and some other prizes which are completely ABSENT in the second game. I like the games. Honestly, I love this game. It's a great game and I have fun playing it. But you know what I appreciate more than the game? The ads. The ads are perfect: they show the gameplay - real gameplay - and are completely true to the game, plus there aren't any weird slogans (\"I can't reach pink color!'). Even the playable ads are great! I downloaded this game because of the ads and I was not disappointed one bit. Thank you, whoever made the TotM ads. You did good.. This game is great fun! Good to play for five mins or five hours (probably but haven't done that yet) I paid the \u00a31 to remove ads. Which I think made it more enjoyable. I'm not really willing to pay the subscription, but was definitely willing to pay a one off because this has been great entertainment during lockdown.", "neg_reviews": "Very fun game, great concept, well polished. Energy system and ads ruin it. I don't want to wait to play the game, or watch an ad after every level. I get the the developers need to make money somehow - cosmetics, optional boosts, or making the app paid solves this problem without making the game a terrible experience for the user, like the current system does. played until I ran out of energy, and will be uninstalling.. The game is admittedly pretty fun but it has the common issue of having way too many ads. You can pay $1.07 to get rid of them at least but otherwise it is extremely intrusive. You can die only five times before you are locked out of playing for half an hour. You can refill energy bars with 1000 coins, but coin buildup is very slow. The other solution is to pay $9.00 a week (lmaoo), buy the coins, or pay a whopping $30.00+ for a game without inconveniences. Not worth it at all in my opinion.. The Game itself was fun, it gave me that old School vibe but pop-up ads after each level or diamond offer trying to trick you into paying the $7.99 a week after 3-day trial no! Who the hell is going to pay $7.99 a week to play a game? they're are hundreds of other games out there that I can download to play for free with a hell of a lot less ads.. You will spend more time watching ads for this game than you will actually play the game. Seems like everything is focused towards getting you to misclick to play another ad. As soon as you open the app, an ad pops up. Right after that ad, you are presented with ANOTHER ad to buy the games premium version. For only 7 $#%!ing dollars, you get the privilege of not having ads. This game is mildly fun, but the amount of ads makes this game not even worth downloading.. Too many ads and in-app purchases. The game itself is very pretty and fairly enjoyable, but the constant pop-up ads, banner ads, and reminders to purchase power-ups and coins from the shop break the game experience. They even try to push a monthly subscription on you. The game isn't worth dealing with all the ads and aggressive IAP. Some ads can't even be skipped.. I liked this game for a bit HOWEVER, it is really bothering. I hate how there are way to many ads and it just appears all over. You guys are a bit over money, there are too many ads that it just ruins the feel to the game. I personally hoped this game would be better but it just doesn't feel right with the ads. If you would please remove ads and let them only appear every 5 games, that would be better than in every game. Buying no ads is a bad way and it just doesn't seem worth it. Please fix.. This looks like a nicely polished game, by why the hell are you charging 8 dollars a week for minor bonuses? even at the discount of 100 dollars a year, you have done nothing in this game to justify 100 dollars a year for some minor bonuses and buffed masks. and the amount of ads shoved into this game is absurd. if you really feel you deserve to be paid so much for this, just charge for the damn game and have a free trial version with the first few levels and arcade mode.. I never write reviews but I felt the need to with this game. The game itself is really fun however it seems that the developers mindset is more on \"how many ads can we cram into the game\" rather than actually making it enjoyable to play. I can't do anything without getting an ad, I win a level, get an ad. I lose a level, get an ad. I accidentally misclick one of the many \"watch an ad\" options and I'm stuck watching a 30s ad with no back option. It's extremely annoying to have 50% of your play. Okay, originally I gave this a 4 star because I don't like the snakes, but the pop up ads are horrible, they pop out of no where and usually tricking you into pressing the \"buy\" button. Constantly you have to watch an ad for everything, to get a life, before and after the game, when you enter a game, for a chest! Sometimes during the game, despite this, it's a fun game.. This game was great a couple of years ago, but now it's full of ads, it's basically unplayable. Every time you; die, restart, complete a level or open a chest.. it will play a ad, the ads are unskiable. You have to play with airplane mode on, for no ads. And don't get me started on how many issues this game has. Like sometimes you won't be able to move up or down, or it won't move at all.. Remove the ads and fix the issues, maybe I'll give a better rating cause right now it's a 0/5 stars. I was first attracted to the game's style (I love arcade games!) and I was surprised about how fun it is while being so simple. I was VERY excited thinking I had found \"my game\" but that quickly vanished. I don't mind ads if they're done/placed well.. BUT HOLY GOODNESS. There's an ad after EVERYTHING you do. There's an ad to claim any prizes/rewards. It is absolutely insane and I uninstalled within 10 minutes of play. And half of the ads were for TikTok with their \"suggestive\" underage girls.... Good game, way too many ads. You cant go 10 seconds without encountering one, and now I get that the devs need to be paid but this is rediculous. Not only is the menu full of ad options, but the main game also forces you through them wether you choose to do it or not! And sometimes you can accidentally press on an ad button without meaning to. Sorry, the game is very good and all, but the ads are too much to make it an enjoyable experience.. Not very engaging. Tutorial is annoying; you have to play through two levels before you can do anything you want to do, such turn off the annoying music. When you open up app the first time it asks you if you a want buy a subscription and hides the no option. It'll ask you if want to watch an add to get bonuses, if you click no, there's still a chance they'll play an add.. Good enough gameplay but it is ruined by how money hungry the game is. Every time you complete a level or die, it plays an ad, AND it has a ridiculous energy system that gives you 5 energy that depletes by 1 every time you die in stage mode and takes 30 minutes to charge 1 back. This is to get you to buy their overpriced premium subscription service which costs $150 a year, which is almost double the price of a higher quality console game. This game would get a much higher score if not for this.. Good game but its ovious they just want money. There are ads after every level, win or lose. They are constantly asking you to buy coins and stuff. You only get a few lives, and they will regenerate after 30 mins. If you lose enough that you have no more lives you have to either, wait, buy coins with real money, or watch an ad.. 1. There are far too many ads. When I open the app, ad, when I finish a level, ad, even in the middle of stages there are ads. 2. There is always that 'PREMIUM' thing, and it's so frustrating. Touch response is horrible and it always uses a shield without me even doing anything. And It constantly freezes. 3. The gameplay is really good, but with all of it's problems, I would have to give it 1 star. I still play it, but it still frustrates me all the time. If you're a calm person, it's good. Meh. The levels I was able to play were fun, but not challenging. The touch controls were not always sensitive/accurate so I would have to watch ads to revive myself after I was killed because of not being able to move. Very, very often I could not make it past the login screen and would get stuck in an endless login spiral. Another very big drawback was that they wanted to give \"personalized ads\" witch means they would give my data to 3rd parties. Not down. Also, so so so many ads.. This game is great, but the amout of ads is why I had to do 2 stars. This game is great and I would rate it 5 stars. Every single level or if you die there's an ad before you start/start again. I understand that the developers need to make money, but they added too much of them. Even if they removed some ads, then they would still make loads of money.. It's a very fun game but all the throw in advertising is really unnecessary and annoying. I don't want to see an ad everytime I die, it makes me not want to play the game. On top of all that the game freezes up a lot and I don't know if that is my device or the game itself. Maybe if the advertising is put down a little I'll give it a better review.. Premium is ridiculously expensive and paid every week. If you don't want to pay every week you can do a one time deal, which is even more laughably expensive. You're trying to learn the game because you just started? Screw you, die five times and wait hours for your energy to come back. Don't like to wait? Buy it with coins. Don't have coins? Pay money so you can actually CONTINUE PLAYING. If the game was actually great and seemed like it was a lot of effort to make, maybe I wouldn't complain.", "pos": "Negative reviews for Tomb of the Mask mainly focus on the limited number of energy lives available, the frequency of ads, and the desire for more levels to be added.

Sometimes I just give up trying after numerous attemps, such a ridiculous waste of time.. I've owned a Fitbit product since Dec 2013. It's been a great resource and tool to monitor my fitness and activity. I use the data obtained to make adjustments that support positive lifestyle changes. It has served as a great motivation tool. As it records those adjustments in real-time, I can see the change which encourages me to continue making adjustments. It's hard for me to imagine not wearing my Fitbit.. Its great. I like the step tracker. Love the workout options. I mainly use it for running, and it tracks your heart rate the whole time, let you know how many minutes it takes you to go a mile, tracks your times per miles, and if you have Google Maps open, it'll also show your route on the Fitbit app. When you're all done, it saves all the information in a clear formats that's shareable via text, email, and to their social media type page. It's really awesome.. I have been struggling with different apps and tracking calories, weight, exercise, etc., but when combined with the Fitbit, this is the only one that has actually worked to help me achieve my goals. It's super easy to use, and it surprised me that my favorite feature ended up being my sleep tracking. Finding out I wasn't getting as much sleep as I thought, or as restful sleep, was eye opening.. I have used my fitbit for several years now and I love the data it provides. Steps are a great indicator of overall energy. When I don't eat enough, they drop dramatically. This data helps me optimize my cuts. Sleep tracking. Useful for determining optimal rest factors. Resting heart rate. I am fit. I hang out at about 46 bpm in my rhr. When I get sick, it goes to 51 about 2 days before I show symptoms. It's is amazingly useful.. I've been very happy with the app...I love all the features and take advantage of the water and food diaries and even the \"period tracker\" as well as obviously using it to keep track of my steps, calories burned, sleep, etc. Honestly it all helps me get a realistic overview of my daily choices that can lead to a healthier lifestyle, and I've made changes for the better based on what I've learned through the app. Highly recommend!. I love it! 2 things i would love added; Body temperature and easier sleep scoring. I'm an insomniac, and sometimes my sleep patterns confuse the app, it doesn't want to log. It would help if you could log naps too. *Edit: now that I've had it longer, I discovered it glitches when I'm manic (I'm bipolar). It has to catch it in a sleep cycle, but I thought that's something you'd like to know.. I really enjoy my Fitbit and the app that comes with it. I love setting goals for myself in steps, in weight, and in monitoring my sleep. The weekly summaries that are sent to my email show my progress. The gentle vibrating reminders every 10 minutes before the hour spur me to walk a certain amount of steps to reach my goal. Fitbit encourages me to get fit and stay fit! As a result, I am getting stronger each day, and the Fitbit app helps me to care for myself joyfully. I highly recommend it.. This is a good app to track your health. It give good data that's is easy to understand. The swimming function is accurate 85% of the time, but that's my only major complaint, other than updates with maps. I'm very happy with support I recieved in replacing first fit2 that cracked on swim lane line during training. No other problems and going strong for over a year.. I have the Fitbit versa 2, and love everything about it, except after about 2 weeks of having it, the microphone stopped working for voice reply on text messaging. It was one of the reasons I bought it. I've tried everything from restarting, updating, and uninstalling the app and putting it back on my phone to fix the problem. Nothing seems to help. And so far customer service has not been able to help. Edit! Fitbit has completely replaced my watch and it works great, thanks fitbit!. Love it. Been using since June 2017. Great app. Especially fun to track your progress and see all kinds of stats on your overall health/fitness over time. Fitbit adds some nice additional touches in there, as well. It is fascinating to see your sleeping patterns, too. (I use the Charge2 model.) I also picked up their scale a year plus ago and it ties into this same app to track weight over time. Works great. Very rare to have any kind of sync issues, either. Definitely worth it!. Fantastic app to replace UP. The only thing I would recommend is including something like a journal that users can customize to record different health events. And, hey, the app is so packed with features that I could be missing several that are already available.. Great for tracking my exercise. I like the fact that I can look at my wrist and see my heart rate, hours of sleep. I have the fitbit versa 3. The GPS is great. Track my food intake. The list is endless. How did I manage before I got a fitbit. Update as of Nov 18 2021. For some reason I had to log in to fitbit from my phone. I normally don't have to. And all the stats I track are gone. Steps gone. Sleep tracker gone. I can get mindfulness water. Food. Menstrual tracker.. really frustrated.. I have a charge 2, and this app works great for me. I can honestly and without drama say that it changed my life. For years (decades) I have tracked my food and tried to track activity but the task relationship between intake and output was a fantasy based on what I thought at the moment (of my exercise). **Clarification: the app is great, the Fitbit watches not so much. In two years, 3 dead Versa, one defective Charge 3 - only my original Charge 2 is still working. 80% bad product quality.. **UPDATE** I have been reading through reviews and i ended up getting ahold of fitbit through the app on a quick chat. After the last update, it shut off notifications.. you have to physically go into the app under the settings, and make sure the \"Enable push notifications\" or something like that is on. I did that all but 5 minutes ago, and that fixed the issue. I do have an android. Usually it works great. Lately it won't even connect to my Bluetooth at all and I have nothing else connected.. Was working great until the last update which I did last night. Then it wouldn't sync with my phone at all! Very sad. . But after trying all the options they suggested and failing I just put it on it's charger (it had only been charged to full yesterday so I hadn't thought to do this right away) and when it got to 100% it started working correctly, synced and only a little of today's info was lost (O2 and heart rate). I'm happy again. If your fitbit doesn't sync try charging it \ud83d\ude0a. I've had three Fitbit devices over the years. First one we had a good run. Took all over Australia. No issues with syncing. App behaved itself. 2017-2020. Lost it somewhere. Replaced like for like. This one the strap hold pin broke through the back of the clasp if that makes sense. Did not last long. Ulta hr whatever. And the app... Most days I would have to uninstall reinstall. Can't sync. Fix it. Early Xmas present replacement is sense. It's beautiful. But same issue already. Might return.. I've been a fitbit fan. I have been using it for years. I just wish they last longer that they do as I am on my third one. One versa lite and two versa 2's. It gets expensive to keep replacing. But the features are amazing. I love the way it keeps track of my sleep, heart rate, steps and more. Especially love the notifications. It helps me know who is calling or messaging me.. A couple of days ago I left a not very nice review. Because my Fitbit charge 3 is screen failing. It was only a year old. But I did call customer service and they are replacing the pebble. Which I am extremely happy about! So I am giving them five stars. I am aware that there is a syncing problem. That I am hoping that will expedite getting that issue fixed. The problem is I am in more than one Challenge and not all the challenges are recording my steps.. My experience has been pretty good with both the software and the Charge 3. I had been using an Android Wear smartwatch, but beyond standard watch functions I really only needed notifications. No issues with this software for me. If food tracking was improved; similar to Cronometer, CarbManager, etc., it would perfect. Fitbit does sync with those services though, which mostly works.", "neg_reviews": "I've now obtained the Fitbit Sense, and after a few months of it working fine, I'm now having the same issues as before. I've followed all the directions to fix it and it's still not synching continuously. This is very disappointing and does not encourage me to continue purchasing Fitbit products. I've been working with Fitbit support to get help on this, only everything they've recommended, I've tried due to past issues. I've been waiting for a response for over a month now but nothing. Edit: I wish I could give this 0 stars, I was sent a replacement by Fitbit in hopes it would correct the issue syncing with my current Sense. I was told that it was showing the new Sense was continuously syncing, I had to send screen shots of the app and my Sense screen to show that no, it's not syncing like they say it is. I was then told to send back the replacement, at MY OWN cost, in order to receive a replacement for the replacement! Horrible customer service, horrible support. I used to love Fitbit, it's now a disappointment and waste of money. This is clearly a device / technology error as shown by Fitbit support saying it's syncing and me being able to show that no it's not. I used to love Fitbit....... I used to have no issues. About 2 updates ago, the app stopped syncing with my fitbit unless I intervened. It took forever to \"find my device.\" With the last update, it's gotten a little better, but it's still not like it was originally. I don't get notifications to my device regularly like I should - like the low battery warning (which is very useful). Very frustrating.. I've been having problems syncing. I have to constantly restart my phone just so that I can sync. Which means that I'm restarting my phone at least 6 to 7 times a day! If I don't, I won't receive any notifications to my watch. I tried the uninstalling and then reinstalling. It worked for a little while, but with the last software update (a few days ago) things are worse. I love my watch, but HATE the app due to me constantly having syncing issues and not getting my email notifications.. I loved Fitbit until this latest update. Once I installed it, it may or may not find my device. Sometimes I can restart my phone and my watch, then it may or may not find my device. I wish you wouldn't mess with a good thing. I have tried everything today, uninstalling, reinstalling, restart the phone, restart the watch, etc. NOTHING works. The watch doesn't even have the correct time. I'm ready to change companies. What a waste, after 6 years.. I really used to like this app, it was easy to use and synced quickly. Now it's always a struggle to sync, sometimes it doesn't at all. I was finally able to sync my device today for the first time in MONTHS. Also the Location settings is a problem. I tried to set it for 'use location only when app is in use' and the app refuses to accept this, basically trying to force me to leave my device location on at all times. Please fix these issues.. The latest update is horrible. I have it set to all day sync, yet practically every hour it alerts me that it hasn't synced. This last time was less than 30 minutes ago. I can't dismiss the notification. And if I simply click it, it tells me it needs to be connected with my tracker. Yet if I sync through the app, it can connect easily. Even turning off all day sync doesn't help.. Constant sync issues... I don't even care about the info it saves... but clock on my tracker is wrong so it resets in middle of the day. All instructions say to open app and sync to make changes... only it won't sync.. won't pair.. won't connect at all. You can't adjust anything on fitbit one without app and sync and they don't work. Very frustrating.. I won't waste my money on this brand again. They have been around way too long to be having these types of issues.. It takes forever in connecting or clicking through anything, and then says connection lost, which I don't know why, everything else is connected just fine to the internet. It's gotten worse since I just purchased a new sense watch. I have a Fitbit Alta, and have been using this app for some years now. I loved how simple it was and how easily it synced and tracked my info. Now, for the past 6+ months, it has been glitching and not syncing, ever since I updated it. I had to uninstall and reinstall a couple times, and that fixed it for a couple weeks. I can't even create a challange anymore! It's really frustrating and I'm about done with this app!. The app itself and the actual Fitbit are pretty good. However, this new dashboard is not helpful. I LOVE the alarm. with the old dashboard getting quick access to my alarm was SUPER easy and awesome. Now, I can't find it in any convenient spot. Very disappointing. It was easier to check everything at a glance with the old dashboard. sync takes forever. Can't watch steps increase from dashboard. can't see your sleep pattern from dashboard. not a good update. can't read text on band screen anymore. The watch is a great, but useless if the app doesn't work! Which it doesn't. The app won't sync or pair. It keeps disconnecting. Like others it is frustrating. The product is only as good as the app. The app never used to be this bad. Fix the sync and pairing issue please!! Otherwise I wasted my money. Thinking other smartwatches are the way to go at this point. I always loved my Fitbits but now the app deters me from buying.. Works great... until it won't. It'll sync maybe twice, or three times, then, no matter how hard you try, even after repeated reinstalls, \"turning it off and on\", and trying the countless fixes available online, the app refuses to reconnect, and sync up with the Fitbit. I had high hopes for this device. Looks like I'll be trying to find something else that will actually work like it's supposed to.. For the last few days, the app isn't syncing. I have cleared everything, uninstalled twice, rebooted & shut my device down. These problems are intermittent, which is really irritating. Please do not provide any additional \"troubleshooting tips,\" I've tried them all! I have even went to the extreme of getting a new device & phone. My conclusion, the app needs fixing.. The new version of the app, updated a few months ago, is terrible compared to the old version. It forces you to give it access to location, while the old version was optional. Now i get constant notifications that it is using battery, even when it's not running, which probably means it's tracking your location. Nice, Fitbit. Also the new version does not sync as easily as the old to my Blaze; it tells me it's\"looking for device\" when it's an inch away from the watch. Not good.. Overall, an okay app. However, I think it is completely and utterly ridiculous that I need to turn on location services to sync over Bluetooth. That makes absolutely no sense. Syncing is done through Bluetooth and the phone is right next to the fitness tracker. Why does Fitbit (aka Google) need my location? They don't. Just more manipulation, to gather more data, to sell more ads. Greed. It's not enough that I bought the device. Frustrating.. When it works, it's great. Unfortunately, it doesn't work most of the time. This app fails to sync with my Charge 3 most of the time, and I cannot find a pattern for when it syncs and when it doesn't. When I discover that it isn't syncing, I have to jump through hoops to get it to start syncing again. Uninstall app, turn off Bluetooth, reinstall app, turn on Bluetooth. Repeat if it still doesn't sync. Sometimes, I reset my Charge 3. Sometimes I restart my phone. I need something more reliable.. Since the last update, I, like many others haven't been able to synch the app to my Fitbit. I tried everything I could think of, including uninstalling and reinstalling the app, to no avail. Later, I found out that it hates vpn; I had to totally disconnect from my VPN before it would allow me to sync. Very unhappy about this. Buyer Beware: if you use a VPN, you might want to reconsider using Fitbit, especially if this issue isn't cleared. You shouldn't have to compromise your security for this.. I have purchased four Fitbits since 2015. After a while, every one of them has stopped syncing with the app. I've spent hour after hour on forums, resetting, uninstalling/reinstalling. I've tried every suggestion under the sun. Useless. I do still use it just to see if I've done my 10000 steps each day but it doesn't log it. Now the clocks have gone back, I can't even use it to tell the time. Rubbish.. The designer needs an award for making a simple app too complex. Trying to do too many things, it fails to do the simple things. The settings are complicated, some are hidden, some completely absent. I don't know if the Fitbit management is using this App. For example when I swipe down and click on my device. It should show me all the things I can set or change in my Fitbit. But for that you have to go to your profile, again click on the device and then you find some settings.. I loved the fitbit charge 2 when I first got it a year ago. I chose this model for the price and its functions, especially receiving notification of texts and calls. Around 2-3 months ago (I believe after the last update) the app stopped syncing with my phone (andriod) correctly. I no longer receive texts and call notifications.

But I think would make it better is if you could make your own level and have all the parts available to you. (But since this game is old I don't expect that to happen) But awesome game! (Also I found out that the original Angry Birds is now gone, so RIP me and my kids childhood). The game is not that bad. It used to be waaaaaaaaaaay better tho! Like, in 2015 it was the best game I ever played but you ruined it. It has too many ads - it before didn't. The game was more simple - now its hard. Now you litteraly have to buy everything with real money, not in-game money, it was different! You ruined it! The ratings i gave is for 2015, not 2020!!!. If you remember the older version of this game that you played on the school computer, you'll love this one. they kept everything from the old version and added a lot more new features. there are some ads in this app, but most of them are optional and out of the way, with cool bonuses you can get for watching them. this game is great and would reccomend to any bad piggies fans.. This game isnt just for kids, I love this game, you can make whatever you want (after some level grinding), it is alot of fin, only issue is with in app buyables, not paying real money on any mobile game. Make a creative world for people who are to poor to buy stuff like this.. This game I played on my uncles phone back in 2012 (I was like 6) and I enjoyed it and unlike most games I played back then, I still enjoy it to this day. The news parts are cool, they still have the old parts and the ads aren't all in your face. 6/5 would recommend. I randomly lost all of my game's memory, in that game I had many coins and 1 star parts (too lazy to get bolts) also I completed all levels. I gave it 5 stars cuz the game feels nostalgic and fun. Also I found some glitches that are so broken. This game is my childhood! I absolutely love this game and im old now...but ive played this game sense i was 3yrs old! and im still playing this game. One of my favorite games \ud83d\ude04 and when the updates came i was sooo happy! I had a blast when i got a ton of costumes and boxes im so happy i found this on the app store when i was little.. Such a fun and unique game. I really love how much content is in there for free. It is a pretty old game tho, so don't expect any major updates soon. Surprisingly, there aren't many bugs. For those who don't know what this game is... try it for yourself. I promise you won't regret it!. Rovio, please. If for whatever reason you're reading this, this needs to be addressed. The recent update, the one release October 20th, completely screws up the game. Loot chests can not be opened what so ever, you have to exit out of the game, and your rewards are not kept. Also, having it so that only wooden, stone, and gold crates instead of the variety before with the daily challenge I think is a bad change. Please make it so you can get cardboard, glass, ect again.. I can't this has to be one most best creative games to exist there was so much things to do you can play some challenges in and earn some items in certain creatives or you can unlock creative modes and build your lifelong and build what you wanted to build a 5-star rating looks low for this it could be a 10 star rating or more but the future does not exist (yet). When I have played this game,it was very awesome & it challenges me in some levels & trains my creativity so that's why I download this game & actually,I like the Angry Birds Friends & Angry Birds Transformers but my phone can't download the Angry Birds Transformers because the MB is too high so I'll just download the Angry Birds Friends next time & for the people/person who's reading this now,I recomend this for all of you/for you. This game is amazing.. A game straight from my childhood. Replayed it recently, and I can say that it's still fun after all of these years! Really cool level design and the concept of the game is really original. I really hope that maybe they will release a sequal in the future that isn't filled with ads and just sucks like most mobile games recently.. I LOVE this game. If you like piggies, explosions, crashes, and challenges, this might be the game for you. But even though this game is free the adds are annoying. But I think there is a way too get rid of them.. This game is probably one of my favourite games ever, I installed the game and played (most of) the levels. Its extremely fun yet challenging to make/control your vehicles! But the thing I would recommend fixing is this game breaking glitch where when you are playing with the suction parts in a sandbox level (such as field of dreams or little pig adventure), the game sometimes freaks out and your vehicle will disappear and you will collect every single star box in the level... Anyways, have fun!. Great game from my childhood which I used to love to play. Re-installed it as I never actually completed it haha. Was a huge fan of the angry bird games when I was younger and it's shocking that they've been removed. Please bring them back as it would make millions of people very happy. Thanks for all your hard work Rovio. Keep up the great work!. So I recently reinstalled the game due to nostalgia and because I missed playing it but some days after the download, when I play on field of dreams and create a machine with suction shot parts, whenever I use them sometimes the machine would disappear and the camera would freeze, because of this I also somehow the glitch marked that I got all 40 star boxes and even played the noise, pretty weird, but overall this is a legendary game.. This game is awesome! Though a very mad bug needs fixed. The scrap pieces that come out of crates is kind of broken, if i get an item that i already have, it gives me scrap pieces, but if there is more, it just doesn't give me more pieces, making it harder to get the rest of the alien items.. PLEASE FIX... other than that i would definitely recommend this.... Okay, love this game, but that's not the reason I'm writing this review. Rovio entertainment, please bring back all your other games. I understand that you removed them because they were losing popularity, but bringing them back would cause the popularity to skyrocket because so many fans will want to revisit their favorite childhood games! Please, please consider it. Sincerely, A huge fan.. I remember this game when I was 7 and it was gold. This game is the only reason I haven't given up on you Rovio. The least you can do is bring the old games back and put ads on them to get money, or you can sellout that's okay, and crush another generations dreams, like you did to us :(. best game by rovio next to the og angry birds series. my only issue i ever had with the game was when i set all my game data to the samsung cloud and google play which had just come out then, and when my tablet broke, I recieved none of it on my next tablet. but thats not the game's fault, anyway. this was almost 6 years ago now and i completely forgot about the game until now. I love the updates to it, as well.", "neg_reviews": "Ok I played this game 6 years ago it was great sandboxes were free to get now you have to get pig coins I mean seriously people 100 coins and it takes super long and that's just the start of it. My game is SUPER glitchy the images are disotorted I have WI FI and I checked everything but you still can't get purchases Really? This game is a huge disappointment . It went from Hero to absolute ZERO.. Error! One more error.no coins!,no loot Crates! and have a problem for Scrap machine!. When we win a level and get 3 stars! We want to get 3 or 6 coins ! (DoubleCoins) but not a signs of Coins! but why! ? How!? This Game has many errors! (only for latest update!.error!). Update 5 (final review) While I have played this game for years, I feel like a second rate customer. After spending money on this game to help me unlock cosmetics in the game, I signed out of the game and signed back in using my Facebook account. All of the purchases I made are gone, all my unlocked items are gone, the only thing that remains is my level, which doesn't really mean anything in game. After losing all my items, I have finally lost all hope with this company and their games.. The original product was an absolutely phenomenal game with simple mechanics and endless creativity. Now it's filled with mollases-thick Ads, paid game modes, a horrible VS mode that is won by player level rather than inspiring creativity and strategy, and a loot box system that actively interrupts and hinders the main gameplay. This product has devolved from a well-made product to a cash grab. It is not worth anyone's time, money, or stress, which is what it caused me: psychological pain.. This used to be a really enjoyable game. However they have set the mechanics to So Random you can only do trial and error and even if you have the perfect ride it can fail 99% of the time through no fault of your own. Also this company has redefined intense greed and pops ads at every opportunity destroying what was a good game!!! If I could give this game -10 Stars I would. This game is also responsible for the destruction of my tablet screen After an ad the hold started skipping and continues. The game is good but the menu won't load! The only screen it keeps me on is the screen with the rovio sign.. So I lost to a person in \"Cake Race\" so I then decided to press \"find new opponent\", but I got the same person and I have constantly lost to him. It's okay , Rovio but seriously, I want you to fix the problem. AND ANOTHER THING, please please please please please please!!!!!!!!! bring back the other half of your games. I know you wanted to move on but we all want 2012 games. Also don't be a \"cashgrab\" . P.S sorry if this report is too long and I know that usually I won't put \"P.S\".. This is a very fun and challenging game but i am getting negative experience points and bolts. Please fix it the code.. Some animations glitch and They don't appear properly. Loading time is horrible. There is no way you could fix this game. It sucks. Don't download. Don't waste your time!!!. Even if the ratings says it is a 4.5!!! No one plays this anymore. Very glitchy (on all of my devices) : (. Love the game. Way too many advertisements. 30-second advertisements almost on every level. On my IPad I bought the full version but can't seem to find it here.. Used to be a very good game, but is now plagued by non stop, full length, un-skippable commercials. The ads make it unplayable. I'd rather pay for it.. Way too many ads to even enjoy the game. I played less than 5 minutes and received 2, 30 second ads, that had to be watched in full before I could continue. Rovio are you so broke that this needs to be the case? If just go out of business.. Advert to gameplay ratio is pretty bad. You spend a lot of it watching video ads and being reminded how you need to find loot crates which you can unlock by watching more adverts. Very sad. It was good is now bad ads ok u need money loot boxes om done, great game for a 9 y.o that is if it weren't trying to get them to gamble on loot boxes the older versions are what I'd like to have back. I can already remember how hard I tried to get some rndm thrown together peice of wood to fly off of soda bottles and a propeller, but now I don't think the magic is there anymore.. 30 second commercials after every 3 rounds of gameplay? After finally getting 3 stars on level 1 and 2 I had to watch 4 commercials. Would love to comment on the game but it appears it's only a part of this advertising app. Seriously, this is sad.. All lever bridges are broken in Road to El Porkado. For instance level 6-18, which is impossible to pass without the bridges. The lever arms aren't even shown on the level which means I am stuck with no way to advance or pass any more levels in that world. Will rate 5 star once that is fixed. Not being able to pass level 6-18 due to the glitch is causing me to miss a lot of loot crates. Adverts overload, I used to play this game about 6 years ago and there are so many advertisement in the game. I wouldn't mind if they were about 5 seconds long, but each advert is like 30 seconds long.. It's a really good game, but I got to level 18 of Road to El Porkado, which is literally IMPOSSIBLE. I even tried using the super builder thing and I STILL couldn't get past that stupid gap right in front of the building zone. It's SO frustrating, so that's why I gave the game such a bad rating.. Best game rovio ever made. The game overall is the same as ever except now the ridiculous amount of ads forced me to delete the app after only a day. Within my first ten minutes of play I saw 8 ads. Forced to watch ads to replay a level is too much y'all. I understand the need for ads on free apps and the developers deserve some form of compensation for the work they did, but the shameless way this company has sold itself to the all mighty dollar is just pathetic.. The game was fun and all but after the angry birds trend died the game stopped updating and they last updated it in 2018 which is like 3 years ago but instead of like removing it from playstore like other angry birds games they still kept it there which makes it realy confusing", "pos": "Negative reviews:\n- The game used to be much better in 2015 but has since become harder and filled with too many ads.\n- Now players have to buy everything with real money, unlike before when in-game currency was used.\n- The recent update released in October 20th has caused glitches with loot chests not being able to be opened, leading to lost rewards.\n- Some players experienced a game-breaking glitch where their vehicle disappears in sandbox levels.\n- The scrap pieces system is broken, making it difficult to collect all items from crates.\n- Users are requesting Rovio to bring back their old games and are disappointed with the changes made to the game over the years.", "neg": "Negative reviews for Bad Piggies HD focus on multiple aspects.

I spent ages looking between games before I chose this one. LOTS of monster variations. A tactical element but fun to play. I noticed that a few people were reporting glitches however I haven't come across any myself. A little disappointed you can't change the appearance of your character beyond \"Male\" or \"Female\" but so far the gameplay is making up for that. I haven't had to pay anything so far either which is nice! I might though because I'm enjoying it!. This game is very much entertaining that I expected.I liked that it has its own story. I liked that it has a cool background music. I liked even the NPCs here can defeat you if you are not stronger enough. I am still playing this game and don't know everything about it now. But I promise that I'll give my feedbacks along with playing this game.. I'll be honest with you, if you're looking for a good monster capture rpg game that has a lot of strategy, good AI battles and PVP in it, this is the game for you. In terms of pay to win, I'm a f2p player and I managed to score rank 200 within a year of playing. One of the best f2p friendly game I've came across, all you need to do is log in atleast 30 minutes a day and you're good, that login time would be worth it too.. This is a very excellent game and I totally loved the storyline! But i have a few suggestions. Firstly, you should add a way to communicate with other players in P.v.P (Example by adding emoji's to send). Secondly, sometimes when i play the game freezes when i make a move and i have to exit the game because i waited for a long time but the game was still not working so my tickets went to waste and this problem happened to me several times.. Its really fun game to play . But takes a lot time to install. And more monster should be added in this game. And you need to fix buges . And can you add more monsters blocks where our enemy has 20 we have 16 why . Please do something . Really enjoying the game . And make more games like this . And i will install it first . But please let it be below 60 mb . And please advertise this game . So that all can play this game .. Amazing. A game with a nice story, balanced difficulty, not really pay to win, the definition of a great game. It's bough, but you can always buy it on a sale, and it's worth it, even when it's not. No ads and great gameplay. Artwork is simply majestic, and I really love this game. Animating is very good, and notable as well. All those people saying \"I sPeNT 60 dRaWS tO gET sUpER ePiCS\" should stop being so childish. Also, people saying that they were forced to buy gems, that's your touchscreen.. AMAZING GAME. Unlike pokemon- neo monsters requires insane amounts of strategy and a little bit of luck in the egg draws. where pokemon is just over level somebody with a good move and maybe throw in a swords dance as a tactical move. neo monsters has an amazing storyline and the online section is great as well. what i would change is get keys faster, get gems easier, gems need to cost less in store (1$ for 1!?) and matchmaking for pvp needs to be more balanced. Thanks for making this game!. This has been one of my most favorite games! They Make it affordable for everybody to play by not making it a Only money makes it fun game. I just started playing I have 2 Mystic 4 legendary. They made it Enjoyable. My only criticism I wish the timeframe for you to get tickets wasn't 5 minutes. I think you should just ignore this great game to have a 3:30 time frame. It drags it out.. Incredibly fun game and definitely worth your time. Reminds me of Monster Farm from back in the day and that`s why I installed it. Mixes old RPGs from the 80s and 90s and throws them into a MMORPG world. Lots of events and rewards with likeable characters who have different story arcs/backgrounds that keep you invested. Collectible monsters are fun, varied, and easy enough to get when it comes to Epics or Mythics. Definitely a grinding game so be sure to have patience; it`ll pay off in the end (Just got my first Mythic). Be sure to collect those Gems and free rewards you`ll find scattered throughout the game; forty equals about a handful of Epics and the possibility of a Mythic (How I got my first). Fun, charming, easy to understand and play, with enough strategy to keep you on your toes. Only Con is the strategy is a bit limited. Highly recommended.. To be honest... One of the greatest games i have ever played on mobile... I have nothing bad to say about it... But there is one thing i noticed... There is one monster that does not show up in game, as in the character model doesn't show, even when it evolves.. It's not something that disrupts my gameplay, it's just something i noticed, but otherwise.. Great game!. This is the second Pok\u00e9mon like game that I had actually liked!! There aren't that many bugs for me so far , and I loved it ! The graphics are pretty decent for a game like this especially the beginning of your adventure , it makes me feel so curios after playing a match while I was still trying to turn into a rookie , thank you very much game Devs , this experience is pretty lit :DD I'm interested to see more games that you guys create! Keep improving game Devs :-). I was lucky enough to find it on sale, and now i can't stop playing. All the gameplay the storyline are so good. This really deserves a five star, but one major problem it's really hard to earn gems even if you play day by day it will take weeks to collect 40 gems and then you will try to summon monsters and you get all just trashes epic monster i really have troubled gaining legendary monster. But this game's good and it's still worth my time since I'm enjoying it.. (Would rate 4.7 stars) Really fun game if you like Pokemon-type RPGs. It can be a little hard to get into, but its very fun and, even though I got it for free, is worth $1. TEN FOLD. Even the egg system, reminds me a bit of that one cat game. (Which I can't remember the name of) But not in a bad way. Only gripe is that the overhead map style movement could be improved. Highly recommend \ud83d\udc4f . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \ud83d\udc15. Game is very good but the problem is with online match making. I started playing since 2 months and I have no mytihic in my team but when I play online match I get a player whose full team is of only mythic and I always loose the match...... This is my problem please fix it as soon as possible....... The game is awesome I'm not gonna lie but you gotta increase the odds of getting better monsters , it took me a while ,months just to get a mythic . The game's movement restrictions also make it boring though, I would really wanna see the action like the ultrablaze , there must be actual fire to get the mood going. You also must add more elemental stuff , like I don't see the point of having an ice monster without any ice attacks .But everything else is awesome though, great game. Honestly, I got the game when it was free and I do not regret it. Actually I kinda wish I could have paid the money to help support the game because it's that amazing. It has a hint of pokemon but with so many more features that we wish pokemon had. It had a vast amount of creatures which you catch using the capture cards and even ways to train them. Though I wish we could get experience points after we win or lose a battle. But other than that I reccomend this game to everyone. I've enjoyed this game for many years and have a few different accounts. This games stresses YOU DON'T NEED to buy to win.of course it takes time to win the game but still a game like thus for a little price is great and the story is cool too. Happy New Year to all Neo Monster players. See you in PVP. To those who love monster collecting game Neo Monster is the Best Monster strategy game. I play this game for 6 yrs. And still I love this game im F2P player and still i have a strong team bacause the game is generous in rewards also the game is not just for Mythic and legendary... Low level monster is good for strategy. But if u want to bcome strong faster you can be P2P player but its up to you. TnxDevs. Continue develop dis game.. I have been searching a game like this since Miscrits was removed. I love it, the features, graphics and how the game is played is so enjoyable. This is an IMPRESSOVE OFFLINE AND ONLINE game\u2661\u2661\u2661. This game is a grindfest. There is literally nothing stopping you from playing as much as you want. Now, I'm not at endgame pvp player. In the reality of android gaming, endgame pvp is thousands of dollars of investment. Don't expect any different here. If you want to kill time, and feel a sense of achievement for your efforts. This game can do it for you.", "neg_reviews": "This is one of the single most disgustingly monitized games I've ever come across. It's little more than a low budget Pokemon rip off where nearly every single action you can make is bound to a timer. You can either spend HOURS grinding out some of the most boring battles I've ever played, or you can shell out $110 for 150 gems. Shame on these greedy developers. Do not buy this game unless you want to be milked for money.. Don't get me wrong, its a fun game. But overall, I've spent more time looking at a screen that says \"Connecting to server\" than playing the actual game. Incredibly frustrating under any condition, but especially so when you use a key with a 12 hour cooldown to unlock a mission for an hour and the \"online server is not available right now\" for 4/5 of that hour.. I loves this game but it's very unfair! I spent over 300 gems and most of what I got was epic and super epic. Not only that, the fight in the main story is very tough. Especially if the rank is already over 80 and above. I know if we use a good strategy then we can beat the opponent. But! The battle getting more and more harder each time i won ;)). The monsters are cute. 1. But there is no point catching any if you can gacha your ass off and get a 5 on the spot. 2. Exploring is boring. Very. Boring. It would be better if we can explore in an open world rather than choosing a region and go along the map. Very linear. But idk this is all just preference and opinion. Some prefer this method of exploring. Well i dont so.. uninstalled. Warning. The first image \"explore a massive world!\", exploring in this game is not like in that image at all.. I love the game and I enjoy every last minute of it. The events and the game play is just great, but I have to say that recently I tried hatching and I'm really disappointed. I spent hundreds of $$ for gems and I didn't get one mythic. I mean I don't mind spending money, but I think you guys should work on your hatching rate. Or do something like when you do 10 consecutive 10x hatches you get at least one guaranteed mythic. I mean I was just disappointed. Hope this gets looked at.. I thought this game would be good until I realized how pay to win it is. There's a newbie promo in the shop but when I tried to use my gems to get it, it told me I didn't have enough PAID gems to get it. The fact that the game distinguishes between normal gems and paid gems already turns me off from continuing to play this game. Any new player, you've been warned!. It was fun until I got to the part about a villager seeing the young version of the main characters uncle and it becoming MANDATORY to make a online account to keep playing the game. If this game is said to be offline, and it DOES say that, then a online aspect should NEVER be mandatory. ONLY optional. Sad. The storyline seemed interesting and it was fun to play. But due to this issue it's getting uninstalled. Glad I found it when it was on sale for free and didn't have to spend any money on it.. I purchased 26 gems in order to play the mythic guaranteed gatcha, which costs only 20 paid gems. When I went to play, the game said I did not have enough gems and asked me to purchase more. I contacted the customer support, and they told me that the bonus gems that came with my purchase did not count towards the paid gems required for the gacha. I would not have even purchased the gems in the first place if I had known. They are too expensive. If you play the game, don't spend your money.. Good imagery, many creatures to aquire. And everything else is a chore, a paywall or gated behind higher levels. Unless you pay money of course. As a free player the game will last you a few hours before the difficulty slams you to the ground and Ground Pounds you, until you waste time and effort (or large sums of cash) to get better. Edit: I forgot to mention that you have to pay to even play the game. Another negative.. Dont buy this game. Half the story is available offline free, the rest is locked behind online content you need gems to unlock in which you no longer get to use your own monsters and must use monsters that are superweak and have 1% chance of winning. Evolutions are locked behind events where you need to wait a month to just unlock 1 ingredient... then you have to wait another month to unlock the next and so on. Game is the most pay to win game i ever played. Really not worth playing.. This game has obviously a lot of potential. One of the downsides is that each time you navigate to a new page there's a message popping up \"connecting to server\". At first I didn't mind, but now, it's getting way too irritating. Either establish a secure connection with the server beforehand or let users download the additional data manually. It's troubling, such a potential game still the gaming experience is not smooth.. Most greedy and most Lying developers ever. It will be just a waste of time and money to play it. The game is fine but they lied to me. For example, in the newcommers egg festival, they gurranted a Mythic egg for every 10th 10 in 1 pack, but they didn't give it when I hatched. Dear players, I recommended you not to make any in-app purchase for this game. It'll be a waste of money for you.. Has really shady business practices regarding game data. They do not automatically restore your game data after reinstall, they need you to remember specific codes which I failed to notice. And now I lost all my game progress along with my in game purchases. Game support is not specifically helpful. They just assure you that you wasted your time and money and we won't help you.. Pay to trivialize. This game embodies pay to win to a different degree of insanity. Not only are you given insane gacha-style rng rolls, you stand 0 chance in combat without a team of \"Mythic\" class monsters. Ranging from, for no reason, dragon and demons to twerking anime girls. No twerking anime girls aren't going to be found as normal monsters. To secure even a single mythic is 25$ for their one time guaranteed roll. Even a single ability on these mythics can beat a whole team. Don't play.. IT'S JUST ANOTHER PAY TO WIN. Recent update has no game balance. Especially in PvP mode. If you are ready to pay more and more to win then go for it. Almost all the opponents I face have fully evolved monsters from recent egg sale. I'm here struggling to get even one. Always matches the most toughest enemies. I was matched with only 3 enemies until I exhausted all my attempts. For more than 10 attempts. Every one either has all autopoison monsters or all the recent legendary monsters.. played for about over a week and i can gurantee this is a tire fire of a bad game, crashes constantly and uses up your tickets after you reload, no developer responses whatsoever which just shows how little they care, the only thing they do is release anime girl fan service as max tier monsters (not sure how girls qualify as monsters) at absurd prices, and is horribly unbalanced at late game. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME.. Willing to change. No doubt it's a pretty good game with nice battle strategy and all. But, getting legendaries (let alone mythics) are almost near to impossible where as the opponent team is filled with legendary monsters. You can spend days and days to save gems to hatch egg, and voila!all you get is the most shittiest available or duplicates. Hardly one or two (seldom legendary) good monsters. Very very unbalanced power distribution. You'll be wiped out in no time. And ticket expenses are a joke.. Very pay to win, it gets difficult to progress later on. The map isn't really open world, it gives you a kinda box you can move in and thats about it. Feels very limited.. Seems fun at first. Decided to save up 20 gems to pay for the 10 pack (1 garunteed mythic) then realized you can only buy it with PAID gems. (This ticked me off a little.) Figured I liked the game enough to support it so I bought the 13x2 gem pack for $10.99. I thought with 26 paid gems I'd be able to buy the pack. Guess what, my 11$ only got me 13 \"paid\" gems and 13 \"free\" gems. I'm refunding the purchase for not recieving what I paid for, and I'm uninstalling this deceptive garbage.", "pos": "Users appreciate the variety of monster variations, tactical gameplay, and engaging storyline in Neo Monsters.

P2W: Yes, you can buy gems for real world money, however, you can unlock every single car in the game without paying a single penny (you can aslo get gems for free by getting a maxed lvld car) 2. MANY ADS: People make a living making this game, they have to get the bread. 3. PRIZES RIGGED: They never said the ods of getting epics or legendaries. And you can get legendaries and epics, it's not imposible.. This is a really fun game for mobile. It felt kinda like playing a console or pc game because it seemed just so big and cool, well in my opinion at least. It provides a good ranking system, unique maps with cool powerups, the only problem I've had is it can lag a little bit, but I have an Pixel 2 with 4gb of ram, and for android, 4gb can't be the best. But it's still a fun and great experience, I could say now that it's one of my favorite games. Good job developers, & keep up the good work.. It's cute with the cars been tiny I think they did a great job and it stunning to play never gets boring that why I think it is amazing the storage is also low thank you for making this game.It is so fun.There's a lot of cars.The things you should do is make car quests less difficult and make more cars of course you don't have to if you dont want.I love playing the game I'm enjoying it. The prize machine always includes a good car.I like that you can evolve prestige items.Add soccer stadium.. I comeback from the game literally 3 years ago and the game is getting better and better! and the reason that i left the game is because its draining fast my battery \ud83d\ude01 i hope this helps for future updates!. Its fun to play you can jout people .If you have wifi you can play with ether people. There are newer stuff like cars and a new map. I like to call it sweets land . I kind of don't like it but i have to dill with it . but i really don't care .I love playing this game no what. It helps when Im bord or when .Im in the car with my sisters .I also love playing with my friends i can find them it can be hard but it's ok.. Superb game! Real cool graphics, fair fights, and too much more just for a 100 mb game. Like even if you have no recourses you can get legendry cars like me. I got 2 legendry cars in a row in the common spin. In the start, you will feel that you are a noob but in 10 minutes of practice you will be able to double kill easily. The shadows are also cool. Google doesnt let me write a long review so i will have to stop but this game has many more things than i just said. Really should try out.. Fantastic game! The vehicle options are extensive. Sometimes it's frustrating when you come across a player who clearly has put some money into this game. But, usually it's only 1 or 2. Otherwise it's a pretty level playing field. Ads are minimal. I'd say only after the 3rd time you get knocked out. I suppose you dont have to pay but for a game like this that really puts in effort (new maps/challenges every day) it's worth contributing. Keep up the good work!. Very cool game. Specially the monster, its my favourite car. You all should try this game. There are a large variety of different powerful cars, powerups like the blackhole, flamethrower, shield,health,cannons,oil and homing missile, levels and many cool maps.The game also have very good controls and the sound is very nice.It is the best game I have ever seen.. I love the game the only game that can rival this one is Drive Ahead by the way great job with the update super cool marion is like a more intense version of dungeon's secret... \ud83d\ude09 and I have one QUESTION why does the crash of cars app show not doppler if I go to another tab and come back. For other players sometimes the app lags if my battery is low. Developers my favorite car is the British Phoenix(my Nick name for energy car ). Thanks so much for making this game. Ok devs. here's the deal. This game is EPIC ok, the gameplay is amazing not to mention the best graphics and it's just amazing I had a lot of fun with this game, but... There is 1 problem that I have been experiencing. The game has been randomly stopping for sometimes and I hope that you can fix it. But other than that it's amazing,you can acquire cars easily (with good luck that is :-D) and I want to suggest 1v1 or 2v2. Tks.. I realy like this game. I like Offline and Online mod. I want to get all of cars. I give this game 5 STARS!!!! THANK YOU CREATORS FOR SUPER GAME!!!. The game is very good \ud83d\udc4d and there is lots of fun and it has hidden car too my request is that you should make more maps. This is an amazing game and it is one of my favorite games! I am on chromebook where most games either have bad controls or don't work, but crash if cars makes my controls better by making them a, d, and space. This way I can play perfectly with one hand! I would suggest this to anyone who wants a fun and entertaining game to play, I play hours on end!. 5 stars for the update and fixing the bugs. Thank you for listening us making the blitz map bigger and higger coin trade. Hoping for the best next patch.. This is literally the greatest mobile game out right now. There's no season pass garbage, there's no painful grind or use of energy mechanics to slow you down. All the unlocks are obtained with progress which is based on how long \"YOU\" want to play. There are some new cars that do cost gems for awhile and aren't obtained with regular progression. but they only cost like $10 and they make them unlockable eventually. Overall this game is extremely fun and i highly recommend it for all ages.. Great game. Feels like twisted metal. The graphics are brilliant. The game play is next level good. It keeps you coming back for more. You earn coins in game and get to stand a chance to get a free car every 100 coins. Such a worthwhile game. It's the best car games I have ever tried because this game is so much intresting that it can also cause addiction but for this game addiction is ok because we can get any car by opening crates no need to harm others for something like other games. For quality I would say that it have little bugs which disturbs playing but they appear only some time. It has no lag which makes it better than other car games.Lots of cars, skins and powers which make it the best among the car games. Satisfied by it. In my opinion this game is very underrated! - I read some reviews and some say its p2w, its not that bad, other say the prize machines are rigged and you cant get legendary and epic cars, yes you dont really get good cars from the normal prize machine, but its so satisfying when you actually get one, and the legendary cars are not even that OP, you can still play the game just fine with any car. - Other reviews say that the matchmaking is bad but this type of game doesnt even need matchmaking at all, you can still get decent amount of coins no matter what level you are or what car you use. You can be patient and just collect crowns and not get into fights. - Other complain about the ads, but they are not that many (compared to other cringe games). You usually get 1 everytime you die, but you can stay alive for a while (5-10 mins usually). And you can watch an ad for 20 or sometimes even 40 coins, but that also means you get more coins from watching ads instead of actually playing so i understand why people would consider this game an \"ad machine\" - Most say that the bots in offline mode is a problem, yes the bots are not that great, but if you want to get some coins when you dont have internet its still worth playing Definitely give this game a try. Great game play and very fun. In top 5 of all time android games! Especially good if you're an actual gamer as this is an actual game game, online multiplayer, pvp the lot. I don't like racing games but I love this. You should definitely give it a go.. One of the best games I've played worth it to spend gems and amazing graphics and gameplay would recommend it to anyone. But can u like make the bots follow player a lil lower cuz if they lock on they won't let go and also can u like give us like a training area to try cars before like buying them and stuff cuz the ability description is hard to understand.", "neg_reviews": "Typical mobile game. Game is alright, but customer service is none existent. Also don't bother with the free gem tasks it's all a lie. I spent hours playing a mundane game but never got the promised gem. I fulfilled the requirements to a tee. reached out to cust svce and got denied because they say I didn't go through the offer wall which I did, and said I already downloaded the game before which I didn't. It's a scam.. it was enjoyable at first but it gets so old when the \"get coins\" feature keeps selecting the same cars disproportionally. So u will max certain preselected cars and fail to get bonus points as the feature keep selecting the same cars over and over and over.... seems like the \"only\" driving idea of the algorithm is get the users to watch more and more ads.... Like I do not know exactly what's going on but someone better fix it. The game just keeps kicking me out of it and I can't even play. Checked my internet and settings and tried refreshing and everything's normal, however the game won't let me back in and just got it and thought it would be fun! Well, I can't question on if it is fun or not because I CAN'T PLAY THE GODAMN GAME!!! Please fix and thank you!. I can't play this game in Samsung Galaxy S Duos 2(GT-7582). I tried many times to open it but wasn't open. It freezes after nearly 1 minute. Tried so many times. Please fix this error... Not Doppler if you read this comment, please change the prize machine to just buying the car we want with the ingame coins because the prize machine is not that fair every time i play the prize machine it always gives me a rare or a common i never got a epic or legandary please change. Watch out for this China owned game, banned in other countries. Fake owner address is in Australia. The real name of the game should be CRASH OF ADS!!. Graphics and gameplay are good and smooth but if you want to play it online with others , you cant even with having a proper internet connection . Worst game if you want to play online with other people , it dont even have well and strong servers . Good game if you only want to play with bots which have a fixed gaming pattern (too much boring) . I dont recommend this to anyone who wants to play with other people online . As well as game has no option for intaracting and talking to other players. Old version was way better. New maps like candy fields sucks. Please give option to select any maps of all the maps like before. Not just selecting 1 of six options that you give. And if you could olease give us the old version back. Missing it badly.. The game has gone from bad to worst. Can't control the car it either goes right or left by itself. Other times the car goes inmobile just sit's there and the car slip's on invisible oil. These update's don't do anything to improve the game..... Love this game, butt loads of fun even though i die alot its still fun. edit: would be much better if ads weren't shoved in my face rudely. \u20acdit: why and how am i only getting rares and commons? This makes no sense at all and its just straight up unfair not trying out new perks for cars. 4th edit: theres no point of earning legendaries and epics if i get commons and rares common sense.. It's useless playing when you constantly lose saved data and the online matches are ruined by the cheap bots. Everytime I start the game it freezes almost immediately. I haven't got to try the game but for the 5 seconds before the game crashes. Willing to try the game out at a later time to see if this issue is fixed but for now I will steer clear of this.. I love the game and I admit that it can become somewhat addicting, but I hate the way it's programed to sabotage you out of the clear blue. Instead of being true head-to-head combat between (human) opponents, it fires weapons from hidden areas of the screen where no cars appear to be located. And the launch is always timed PERFECTLY, so that you are not able to avoid being hit. So I can no longer justify a five star rating for this game like I used to.. I played the game for 2 years it's fun but I recently had to remove it because of my storage and now I download it it doesn't even give me all the cars I had I had the legendary tank and the legendary race car and the flying ship and now I have to restart I hope you guys could help me because I'm not very happy I worked for nothing. This game is seriously ruled by pros and hackers. If you are not hacking or playing for years, theres no way to get ANY points.. Fun game, with one major flaw. As you play, your efforts are rewarded with 'gems' or 'prestige points.' If you're a regular player, you can max out on prestige. Once you do, you don't get anything for unlocking new cars. You get some favorite cars, then don't really want to get anything new because the points you get mean nothing. It's almost better to keep getting the same ones over and over, eventually you start getting gems. Prestige points = weapon upgrages, but EVERYTHING else requires gems. Need help and will give five stars. Just got a new phone transferred data over but lost all my Christmas mints (a round 250) and also lost multiple cars/some cars just lost part of their health. Any help is appreciated. Great game other than this but this is the second time its happened. Spam lots and lots of ads malware. Data usage these guys are scammers it's not the people that's playing the game. It's the Developers. They will delete your account and a hot second. Because they are they are a bunch of girls thinking they going to get rich off of game get a job like everyone else so think about how many people I'm going to save and they are not going to download this junk and I also submitted to Google Play of all the corruption you all got putting people through.. Fix the bots. They are cheep like hell, shoots deadly accurate blackholes across the map, snipes you with cannons even tho they cant see you, follow you to ram you to death even if they have no weapons and will die in the process. And then, you have to pay currency(real money) to play the mode where you can fetch the materials to craft the christmas loot, using only the worst vehicule that cant be upg. while clearly half of the cars are only after you...

I mean Graphics are great, Gameplay is Good and controls are very simple, just tap-tap-tap. But sometimes it stuck after winning the battle and can't do anything and I know its still in Beta State, so, I'm just providing feedback. And so far this is the only issue I've got, hope It'll get fixed soon. Although the game is very interesting.. One of the best AFK mobile games I've ever played. Played AFK arena for a long time before finding this game, and I can't even look at AFK arena now cause it seems so bad compared. Graphics & animation are top notch, great character design, awesome story(if you care about that sort of thing). And no, it's not pay to win at all. For people that says they can't progress, it's an AFK game, it takes time to progress. Perfect for people who love RPG progression and have a busy schedule.. Fun all around game! Like AFK some money stuff if crazy expensive and likely not worth it. At the same time, there is a good bit for free to play stuff and you can enjoy about all of the game without paying a dime. Battles are fun. Strategy for team building is fun to play with. After learning battle strength doesn't always mean a lot, I noticed you can push further than you think. Would recommend giving it a go.. Pretty decent game. Character design is kind of ripped but they're creatively different enough to pass for me. Only complaints I'd have is 1. The ads for this game are kind of ridiculous. You can combine duplicates of heroes, but as far as I can tell, all that does is promote them and raise their stats. Doesn't change their appearance drastically like the ads lead you to believe. And 2. The script for the story is kind of broken in some parts. Makes it kind of lackluster and cheesy at times.. Great game!!!!!!! It really is amazingly fun, and no stress or frustrations. I've played other games that make you want to throw your phone due to bugs or un-even pvp. But this game is not like that. Plays smooth and there's so much to do. You'll get to know and love the characters in no time at all. Idle is the way to go. The strategy and character development are the true skills you perform. Great game... thanks devs!. An update. It's a fantastic idle rpg, lots of content, truly idle, you won't spend hours on it, but you would want to play it every day. It's not pay to win! Progress and hero aquisition are satisfying. Definitely worth trying. Customer support is answering quickly. Updates are frequent and bring more content, which in most cases is player-oriented. You can become a great champion and prove yourself in many areas of the game.. I give it 5 stars because I enjoy the character stories and design. I love the gameplay and how easy it is to level up characters. One thing I will say though is that, please pay close attention to dialogue and sentence structure. As a proofreader and editor, I have found a few grammatical errors and one thing that I personally think doesn't fit in with the story: the word \"guys\" just sounds too modern for this game. There are other mistakes in some character biographies. But, solid game.. Really fun easygoing game, much more entertaining than the other well-known idle games I've played. In fact, it's the only one I keep returning to play. Wish I tried it awhile ago because I finally don't have to \"work\" my butt off, I can just have fun. Which is the entire point of playing a game! That said; I'd really like to discover what I did that has me unable to view the story cutscenes... I love the way it's done, and hate missing out on it.... I love this game. A diamond in the rough as they say. For me at least. I zig zag and hop from game. trying to find a really decent idle RPG for me and although I'm not terribly into team building and all that or multiplayer, I still couldn't help but love this game. I've had it for about a 2 months and play everyday. Nothing but good things to say. Put just a bit.. maybe $25 into it and have gotten back much.more than that's worth in great, fun gameplay. Thank.You developers.. The game is has been back up and running i just had to restart my phone. Anyways I have a feature suggestion. Ummm.. maybe add a campaign/tower of babel blitz, in which when a player has passed campaign stage 10-15(you choose) the player can then in any stage 16 an above blitz past them if they are strong enough to clear the entire campaign stage and will stop once they are beaten or cannot fight due to a lower combat level than that of the enemy, this is just for convenience. Also amazing game. Great game, good graphics, and over-all just great. I would like this game to have more places to loot EXP, just in-case I use all of mine instead of waiting for the idle drops, but still great game. I love to play it and it's really relaxed. Though, it might be a grind in some levels, and it would be useful if you can replay past stages/bosses, it's the best. I would say that it's even better than AFK Arena lol. This is super adictive and the daily quests aren't that hard. Best game.. It's a great experience to have this game. But, I played it for a year and already feel bored playing this everyday, all the events still the same, just looping. When you're a high level account, it's getting harder to fight in the campaign mode. I have to wait till 2-3 weeks only to clear 5 part of a campaign. It's Pay to win again in the end to make it more fun. This is a very fun game. The art is beautiful! The game play is like other idle games. I really like how easy they made hero management. The dismantle feature really takes the stress out of leveling up heros. If you level one up that doesn't work out, you can just dismantle that hero and transfer all that experience to another hero. I also like the feature that lets me select heros to be at the level of my 5th highest hero... Again, less worry about leveling. My favorite mode is the labyrinth!. I wanted to update my review! This game was a bit of a roller coaster ride. I initially gave it 5 stars, then they did some changes and i gave it two. But honestly, I logged back in after a few months, and then I've been logging in every day for over 2 years. They are constantly putting out content, and making new heroes! I have put some money into this game, but for.the most part (with some patience) you can play this game for free and have alot of fun!. Surprisingly fun. I wasn't expecting to like this, imagining a Raid with some idle functions thrown in. While the story does thin out after a bit, it is supplemented in other areas. There are a large number of play styles and they are very generous with their premium currency. The character selection is distinct and colorful, with a wide variety of unique looks that make it easy to identify each. They do flog their offers, but not to an excessive degree. Good game.. The gameplay is enjoyable and very bursty. The only issue i have is the 20 pages of dailies and achievements in the game menu. I mean, you get rewards for everything to the point where you have to click like twenty tabs to see them all. The notifications know no end and sometimes it could just be an ad for an item in the shop. So you go through all the pages like: \"ad, 20gold, ad. 20 of some other currency, ad.\" It's pretty annoying.. Hi moonton! I'm just here to say that I love this game! Tbh it's more better than mlbb,you can play carefree,and will not lose many points if you lose a match,I started playing this game a few days ago and I'm already in love with it!!and what makes it more better is the summoning!compare to mlbb,it's kinda like a gacha game,although sometimes when you're not lucky,you can't get some ssr,but again!good game!keep up the good work! (Please give me lunox,,heheh). Beautiful graphics and animations. I love everything about it. No ads, no shoving things in my face and trying to get me to buy things. Gems, which is the premium currency, is easy to obtain. Plenty of things to do without it being too difficult. I like the look and art of RPG games and the likes but sometimes it gets to be too much and I get overwhelmed. This one I just sit back and watch. Then level up and adjust. This game is truly awesome.. Amazing!!!!!!! All of it is amazing!!!!! The graphics are great the characters are cute and the grind is kinda easy here. Like I dont mind doing the stages to get the purple jewls cause it's kinda easy and that's amazing I played before the redesign of the layout and I gotta say so.much improvement has been made since the previous version good job mobile legends your my favorite game to play. The game is very great now than when I started played this game now there's have a lot of resources can get and a lot of participating events and competitions and mostly a lot of unique powerful playable characters such as SSR characters like Odette , Guinevere , Lancelot and more. hoping add some more elite , epic , legend skins and characters someday", "neg_reviews": "Very very bad, P2W game, can't progess or upgrade heroes without paying huge sums of money. bugs and freezes. you can't customize the heroes. chance rate of buying good heroes is 1 out 100? total rip off of other idle games that don't FORCE people to pay to win. just stick to mobile legends please, this game is so badly imbalanced. uninstalling. I was actually rather disappointed. the mechanics of the game are pretty reasonable but as I played for a month or two I discovered there was no actual way to get to the good 5 Star cards without spending money so I quit playing. there is no way to collect their shards and you need many of them so you can't random draw them either. you can Farm most of the other Heroes but not the top 5 so you're trapped below the spenders no matter what. I like the game play, and the pay to win aspect of the game doesn't become apparent until you get 7 stars heroes. Afterwards your progress will be slowed considerably, as you don't get enough resources to upgrade heroes and will hit the level cap, which also requires summoned heroes to fuse, but % to get 5-star heroes is way too low. Arena is still broken. I like the ruins and dungeons, but it has limited availability and can get repetitive. Packs and skins are way too expensive!!!. This game is disgustingly P2W even among those used to gacha based games. It gives the illusion 5* rolls are good but they can be combined all the way to 25* which will require massive spending to achieve getting a 6* as a f2p will take forever meanwhile even the campaign becomes extremely hard early on unless you spend there is no fun or strategy to this just never ending spending without any real fun game mechanics.. Two stars because while I enjoyed the game (graphics, mechanisms) I was due to receive a free Hero during the Dragon Descent event running now. After completing all the requirements I think a bug prevented it from showing up in my roster. Furthermore the mechanism for reporting bugs is broken in game?! This game requires a lot of time effort and certainly funds if you have them to progress, if I can't guarantee rewards after it then why should I invest? ID 16774017. Everytime I try to play the game I start at the tutorial when I go to do the first battle it says it cannot load because I'm not logged in. I submit a ticket to customer support there response was delete the cache if that doesn't work uninstall then reinstall the app. I did both none worked I resubmitted another ticket and have yet to hear back from customer support. I am just going to uninstall for good, save yourselves the hassle.. The game is thrilling initially, but as you progress, the \"luck\"-based algorithm manipulates the outcome of the summons, forcing you to consider buying resources to improve the performance in the game. Till level 30, you can expect 5% 5* heroes. Then till 50, it reduces to 1%. Beyond that, you'd better have a ton of patience. They become as rare as the sighting of the Yeti. My advice: do not invest in the game until you've gotten at least 5 awakened heroes.. It's a decent game, but it is definitely a pay-to-win setup. I've been playing a year now and even in the events they make it seem like you have a random chance to win things but this is never the case. Their calculations always make it so they win and you have to spend the max amount of money to gain items, heroes, upgrades, etc. Unless you have thousands and thousands of dollars or 25 years to play this, literally avoid this game. This game defines all pay-to-win games.. A complete ripoff of AFK Arena that is just as boring and broken as this game. They both have disgusting pay walls and expect people to shell out money for random uselessness. The graphics are okay, but the story, the art, and the events are pretty useless and scale badly. These idle games have no idea what they're doing. Cookie-cutter garbage regurgitated by companies that have nothing new to bring to the table, but expect to cash in on the cow for as long as possible.. This game started out at something new and refreshing, with decent drop rates in events and what not. But in the last 4 months or so they have brought drop rates down in all events and for regular summons. Focusing on pay 2 play aspect even more. So if you're thinking about starting out in this game. Don't, because it's not as good as it used to be regarding drops. You can put in a lot of money and get nothing, but if you're f2p... You get even less then nothing. \ud83d\ude05. Standard Arena system is unfair. You can be attacked 10x but you cannot take revenge even once. There must be a rule that if you touch a player you could touch them back. The current system is biased towards players who have strong team but low ranking.. I used to rate this game 5 stars. Recently, I found that players could specifically target other players in PvP to either farm ranking points or targeted deranking. These sort of poor system management only drives my disappointment in the developers for not looking into reports to fix this. This game is no longer worth my time. It's turning into a game for whales. Another annoying thing is the push notification. It is sending false alerts about unclaimed idle rewards.. Like everybody else said, the game was good until the last update. As a mostly F2P player, you used to be able to make decent progress. With the new changes, daily rewards, and rewards in general are meaningless. They are really pushing this as a P2W game now, which is sad because the gameplay itself and graphics are pretty solid. I literally can't collect enough resources to evolve my heroes anymore... If they don't make serious changes I'll be uninstalling.. The game is fun, but based on the following two issues, I am downgrading my review. 1. Someone living in my house is unable to connect to the same server I am on, meaning I am unable to play with my friends. 2. Customer service is all bot. If you email the help support listed in the Google Play Store is an email system that sends you 2, emails. The first says: \"Sorry to keep you waiting, your problem is being processed, please be patient and our staff will reply to you soon.\" And the second, without variation: \"hi, if you meet any recharging, payment, account, lagging issues, or bugs in the game, or have suggestions for us, please contact us in the game. so that we can collect your info and solve the problem better. (tap customer service > choose corresponding type of the issue > fill in the form and submit) if you meet any account lost, please using new account to contact us in the game. so that we can collect your info and solve the problem better. tap customer service > choose lost account > fill in the form and submit) the mail is only used when you have trouble to enter the game or hacked account. thank you very much\" In-game, the Support feature is just a bot with articles and FAQs available. If you play this game, know there is absolutely no support for it. After posting this, I know I am going to get some kind of note from the publisher apologizing and asking me to contact them through the provides resources......thing is...nothing happens.. The game is alright but the reason for my low scored review is that: I'm just very dissapointed. The current story of the game ends at mid-Chapter 3. With this game being in development for a long time, I expected it to have a lot more content. But oh well, looks like I'll have to wait for a few months/years for that. --- Also where's Nana? X.Borg is coming but some od the original heroes haven't? Sad. -- And what's up with the customer support? I've heard so many negative things about it... It used to be fun to play until this update, it makes everything so difficult. Raising the price of every item, add in useless item that does not help the game but earn themselves money, removed all fun part, interesting event and only put in the element that allow the developer to earn money. I know you have to earn money but not this way. I used to buy item until VIP6 because i feel worth it, but after this update, i think its time to say goodbye to this money vampire game. Terrible.. If you are looking for something to actually play more than 10-20 min/day, then don't waste your time. You are unable to progress by playing, grinding, or farming. Reset timers on everything required to upgrade your team restrict progression unless you pay $. Though you can obtain everything without paying, it will take you infinitely longer because of the 1-3 day lockout times on quests and events. If you want something to play for hours a day and really enjoy, this isn't for you.. Free to download (a norm by now) but HEAVILY P2W game. Sure you don't have to spend money, but this is one of the game that you won't enjoy unless you spend. If you just started, you might feel like you can compete with others who spend with all the events but give it a week and you'll start to notice how far you were left behind and it will only get worse. There's a campaign mode but even that you will notice how longgggg it will take to progress unless you spend.. Not a fan of how the game constantly throws deals in your face and stops you from playing the game every 10 minutes. There's basically nothing to do during down time, the game incentivizes you to literally not play it for hours on end just to get back on and play for a couple minutes then get back off it for the rest of the day. Very boring, not a fan, and constantly having offers thrown at me was obnoxious.. I really like the character designs and combat for a gacha game, but unfortunately there's two big problems: 1. Its too hard to star up your heroes without paying, i have been stuck at 7 star for a few months now. 2. There's not much to do in this game besides labyrinth (even that comes once every two days) so i can only play like 5-10mins a day. Such a waste of potential.", "pos": "Negative reviews summary:\n\n1. Game sometimes gets stuck after winning battles, which can be frustrating.\n2.

But after I made a purchase to get premium status, and a character with some extra rewards, the only thing I received was the character. The customer service said that the pack was delivered and my premium is the right amount yet mine shows 0$. I did NOT get what I paid for. So yeah play but don't invest since this team obviously can't be trusted.. This game is insane!!i leveled up to 70,maxed the ability,get legendary item in less than 2 days.no recharge included,just hours of grinding levels and materials.the event exchange is very helpful since i have to use a lot of gold now.i recommend this game to everyone.but the main problem is getting pet.its tremendously expensive.and also please put new fighting mechanics.there is not much of the ads problem.not a pay to win for me. This game is awesome. But for the boss levels, if you may some extra loot like more resources, so it may help us in the next levels. The boss loot are a 10 to 15 percent more than the normal loot, I wish if it may be rounded to 20 or 25, and can you lower the price a little bit for those armours, cause it is a little more over affordable, and if you want to like, instead of buy from the store instead killing people, it should be costly cuz it is over affordable. Well the overall, it is the best.. When i bought this game, i was like this better be worth the money i gave it, and it truly was great and it really feels like a complete game to think about there's gonna be more updates oh boi i really made a good choice here. anyway this game is truly amazing from my experience. l like the where this game is going. It is a very good game, believe me, it's worth buying but at higher levels of upgrading Armor and weapons, it takes sooo much gold so pls decrease the amount of gold used for upgrading and add more chapters after all it's a good game.. If there is a way to connect account with google play games. It will be very helpful. Thank you.. This is a great game. Controls are very easy and no lag. Events are very lucrative on their rewards. You dont even need to pay to make you character stronger. And what I like the most is, devs are very responsive on reported problem. I bought an item, my money was deducted but i didn't receive anything. So I contacted the devs, and in the end they give my item. Continue the great work guys!. I've been playing this game for 6 years in a row and nothing boring came out on my mind PS: This letter is for you developers to show you how I appreciate your hard work during this pandemic i know some of us is struggling with the pandemic but I know that there will be a day that this pandemic will be over\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude01. Absolutely amazing game. No need to buy anything the events and all are absolutely lenient and will give hoardes of stuff for free if we know how to grind. For me I got ancient level stuff at level 100.There are so many free items and farming possibilities that I absolutely sky rocketed my BP to nearly 4M from 400k in 3days and people say its a P2W\u2014NOT AT ALL. Just try to do the events and you are rich in a few battles. Hope it helps :D.Great Job ZITGA.. :). This game is the best i ever played..... Addicted and i had play it twice and it still the best game.... I wish you fix the joystick and the character reaction that a little slow while attacking after dashed... Otherwise i hope you will add some new items... Thats all for me.... This is the best game!! :). I loved this game this is my overall favorite game i am 10 but since there was a sale i got it and i cant stop playing any other game i open I get bored in minutes but thos game i barely can close the game and I only close it when I'm out of stamina this is a very good game i like the effort you did even the bosses are hard and makes the game competitive so i loved it, it deserves 5 stars. The graphics are very good. The tutorial is quick but simple and easy to understand. Continue the good work!. A very fun game. Nice graphics. Not heavily centered on p2w. Different elements and styles making it never boring. Deserves the 5 stars from me.. Hello Zitga This is the most greatest game in the world and the system is very good and you guys even sell this version on 0.00$ (well sometimes) and the pets in this game are my very favorite also can you add a free event where you can get free pets but you have to complete 10 quest's to have a pet but each quest will have a difficulty and also win a costume but the costume's quest are medium medium medium hard very hard ultra hard to and best game in my life. To be honest when the first time I install this it was really kind of boring for time to time and deleted it,but after 1 year I install it again and I am very proud of the things that change this game and it's the best stickman game ever! :). I like this game because I slain so many Monsters I buy some costumes i like the black market I buy so many of them I can't beat the gaint spider I just love this game ZITGA you made the best and amazing game! Just edited and i have a question when you re download the game will you have everything you had from the past? Pls answer. Awesome game. I love the fact that you can create many customizable characters and the fact that you can change the graphics. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! \u2b50\ud83e\udd75. (Update) It works properly now. I don't know if you would add this and I dontknow if it's in already but could you add more create character slots? It would just cost gems probably like 250 then keeps going up 250?. I love this game but it lacks a way to better manage itens. There should be an option to sell by rarity or at least be able to select multiple itens/scrolls/resources to sell at once. Please consider adding this. Very amazing game very nice offline game you don't get addicted too, very nice graphics. No need of spendingbmoney on it. Loved it", "neg_reviews": "The only reason I gave 2 stars is because I actually enjoyed this game for a bit. But the more I play it, the more I am starting to hate how disgusting the practice is of this game of making you buy stuff. It punishes you if you don't play for a while, It punishes you if you play unless you watch ADs, the money making practices in this game are never ending. I honestly feel horrible i even spent some money on this game because it just urges you to spend more and rewards you less. Just digusting.. I invested 100 rupees on 100k gem...It showed me in the beginning but when I opened the game next time all the gems were disappeared and the amount is deducted from my wallet.. You guys are totally rubbish I mean who do this which kind of strategy you use how your teams designed the game if combined lvl 3 item with cosmic...... Then i should get back mylvl 3 item not a single level item. Sue your service..... Very bad experience.. Not only did I pay to play this game I also bought some items in their store and what do I get? Nothing. On my first purchase I get nothing. I contacted support only to be told to wait 48 HOURS! until they actually try to do something about it! And they even blamed google for it. This is not the first game I spent money on and never was I made to wait 48 hours. Then they asked for the purchase receipt and my character ID and guess what? Still nothing. Been way more than 48 hours already.. A game with so much potential, demolished by immense greed from developers. Don't expect to enjoy this game without spending 100$+ in it. Did i forget to mention a lot of cool things are paywall as well, including characters?. at 1st it seemed like a good game but after about 10 minutes of playtime it became apparent that this was very much indeed a P2W game. you cant unlock other characters unless you pay a $2-6, which may not seem like much but when u realize that not everyone has money or wants to spend money by throwing it into the fire that is this hot garbage of a mobile game. if ur going to charge $2 for the actual game, don't overprice the everliving frick out of everything in your game, and dont make it p2w. at 1st it seemed like a good game but after about 10 minutes of playtime it became apparent that this was very much indeed a P2W game. you cant unlock other characters unless you pay a $2-6, which may not seem like much but when u realize that not everyone has money or wants to spend money by throwing it into the fire that is this hot garbage of a mobile game. if ur going to charge $2 for the actual game, don't overprice the everliving frick out of everything in your game, and dont make it p2w. I found the game interesting, but I paid fo the game and the game still have ads to be watched... I think that is lack of respect with the buyers. We have to pay and still watch videos to be able to win things.. Ads Ads Ads Ads and more Ads... Unfortunately the game is very obnoxious about the pay to progress... Also you have to buy everything with real money to feel any progress and diversity. Edit: Like I said, and see the developer's response. It's Pay to progress. Pay for fun. Pay for everything. It's funny that it takes you 1 min to complete a level and then 30 sec of Advertisement. When the update came out i couldnt update it now i fixed but when it updated i lost all my progress i was level 94 now im level 38 i had over 20000 gems and 2000 energy now i only have around 400 gems and 100 energy i had 74 skips now i have 34 my points on the event are gone and the 7 day challenges i lost have of the campaign i was on the boss on the dragon cave and now im back to the ice phoenix i had lost of 6 stacks of metal shards and a bunch of other materials Please can you help me out.. I reinstalled the game because you told me so , the issue was fixed, but lost all of my progress in the process. I really am sad 'cause i was pretty far in the game, but lost it all. I did save it before, but it wouldn't let me, it only made me wait for a long time. I hope you fix this bug and I hope that others won't have this issue too. I'm still gonna give it 2 stars because it was still a really fun game and very well made, just hate that all of that fun was taken from me by a bug.. I paid for this game yet its still pay to win definitely not recommended, at least when you pay for something don't make the game to be pay to win, sure you can but stuff but just to boost your performance.. Worst game.. extremely pay to progess..developers are deads.. money greedy management , don't play and give them money.. until they change combine method... Wish there was an option of giving minus( - ) or 0 star rating option i would surely prefer it...Everything is very costly.. Literally 95% things in game is related to purchase.. had an account with paid heroes 1 year ago. and after re-installing it i cant retrieve my data. no save load from my previous account. Never connects online. Always \"cannot connect to server\" shown whereas all other apps on the phone can use it fine. All permissions given.. God this game is so pay 2 win u can't even get through the first boss without an ad or gems witch you have to pay or grind for. Do not waste your life playing.. The gameplay mechanics and character designs are very enjoyable, but in order to unlock new characters you have to pay $9.99, which for most people is way too much. You could play through the whole game without paying money, but it would become monotonous and unenjoyable, as you have nothing to achieve. I understand that developers have to make money somehow, but $10 for just one character is ridiculous, so crazy in fact that I bet if they lowered the price dramatically they would make more money. It's good to play and I hope to top it up, but the deception of pvp other players like Shido when he attacks round in the air will continue to rotate when he is on the ground.

Problem was that there were way too many ads; an ad popped up after every action. So I decided to purchase the no ads option, not realizing it would take away even the ads where you receive free coins fir watching. So once the coins are gone you have to keep repurchasing coins. I'll miss the game but I'm not doing that. \ud83d\udc4b! UPDATE: All the problems were fixed! Works great now!!!!. I really enjoy the game and unlike most reviews I don't have a problem with the number of ads. They're mostly short - some are only 5 seconds. I'd gladly give it 5 starts but for 2 issues. 1) about 1/3 of the time, if I close the app (because the games can take a long time if you're doing well) the game I was playing isn't saved. I open it up again and have to start over. 2) There are NO instructions or tutorials so you have to guess at how the few powerups (hammers, preview, etc) work.. A wonderfull game and it improves our knowledge. When I am bored I play this game all the time. The only problem is there are too many ads please see that please. Hope I may get reply as soon as possible. Love the game!\u2764\u2764 I play it for hours and don't get bored with it at all! The only time I do actually stop is when my battery is dead (I hate when that happens) and when that does happen thankfully my progress saves for the next time I want to play. It's the best game ever, the only thing that would make it better is that if it had some levels or daily challenges at least, but still the BEST GAME EVER!!! Keep up the great work!\ud83d\ude01. It's really amazing game that not only let you play but it makes your brain to take the decisions quickly and effectively. Satisfying!!! But I think there must be a super power hammer which can let you destroy any \"tile\" in any time and in any amount ofcourse for which you have to pay a big amount of coins. I think this can make the game interesting and more easy to play and one more thing you must increase the numbers of hammers from 10 to more at one time purchase. Thank You\ud83d\ude0a. Loved playing the game for about a month. Mini ads (5 secs) don't bother me; developers need some revenue. Also, feel the same way about the ads for boosts. About a week ago, however, there is a bug that freezes the game whenever u try to watch an add to get a boost. No way to send feedback or log a ticket. :-( Will wait another week and then will uninstall if not fixed. Edit. Nov 12 Revision. Devs fixed the bug. This is my now my goto game when I want to kill some time.. This is honestly the most fun I've had with a mobile game. I got an interactive ad for it, and was kind of disappointed by the top reviews talking about excessive ads. I ended up really enjoying it tho, the ads are really minimal so good on them for development!! Never thought I'd like a game that's basically Number Tetris but here I am gushing about it in a review. If you have a lot of time to spare, 10/10 recommend. I was playing happy wheel and this game's add came and then add overs but his demo came i was playing it in add only half an hour gone but demo doesn't go then after five minutes demo gone so i like this game so so so so much\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d now i am telling you that those are saying that so much adds are coming i guess the doesn't have sense \ud83d\ude44 you can just off your network then play it \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12 i play it like that only now dont say that adds are coming \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12 OKK! This game is the best! \ud83d\ude0d I love it so much\ud83d\ude0d.. i was intrigued by this game when i saw this on an ad in wattpad. then i installed it and boom! I freakin love it. i got my friends to play it too. and now we are competing on who's going to get a high score. this game is super addicting. it's the kind of game that will make you feel so smart even though you're not lol. Great game to wake yourself up, it excercise your brain in a balanced, smooth way. You have fun playing the game while your brain increases its reflexes and quick mental maths! It can also be quite satisfying when merging too. The only thing is the ads, like all free games. Though because the game is offline and doesn't require internet or data, you can just turn your WiFi off when playing, this will stop any ads, though you can't revive yourself for free with no ad \ud83d\ude44. Overall a great game! \ud83d\udc4d. Overall great. I hate math but love this game, I guess I can play the game and memorise my multiplication. I honestly would tell any kid who hates math and has a hard time memorizing their multiplication about this game. I'm not good with multiplying by 16 because I never really got past 12 because I had a hard time memorising past 12. So this helps, thank you.. Fun, relaxing, addicting. Love the boosters (even if the ads do get repetitive) so I don't have to spend money in the game if I don't want to. I'm excited about the tournament! Sometimes I play too long but it's a good way to waste time. I really enjoy playing this game but I wish that it went up in levels instead of just continuing 1 game and u constantly repeating it or trying to get a higher score. Plus a good idea would be to have like maybe 2 games going at once and it just keep getting harder but it is very fun cuz I have sat here and played it n I don't get bored with it yet and I've been playin about a good hour now.. Immediate 5 stars, I love this game. It's so relaxing and a really good calming game. I would deffinetly recommend, But when I try to play music while playing this game, It sometimes gets cut out at random times. And to add to that, I get adds everytime I try and do a new round. Other than that, awesome game!!. Yhis game is very interesting. My mom loved it so much. It is just entertaining it even develops our brain \ud83e\udde0. I love game so much. But the thing is that it includes a lot of ad's. So please reduce it. You see people always say bad things about the ADS but I don't see what's bad about them. The ADS don't always pop up when I play. The game is fun is easy. You mach the number with the number. With the ads people always say they pop up in the middle of the game they don't , they pop up when you finish a game not in the middle. Like there's 1 or 2 ads not a million. People say there's a million ads NO there is ONLY ONE OR TWO people. Just so you know I am not being mean i'm just saying the truth.. I honestly love this game. I play it a lot and it's one of the few that I can continue playing for a while without getting too bored. Also - but I don't know if this happens for anyone else or what triggers it - it sends me notifications that just say 'You are really awesome' and that's just sweet.. This game is very fun and addicting the ad was made well and it plays a little different from the ad but still very fun. I see some reviews saying how it is not like the ad not sure if they are older reviews and you updated it or something but it such a small difference it does not make a big difference in gameplay. It is very fun and not ramped with ads like most mobile where you get an ad every 10 seconds. It's fun and I enjoy it.. If anyone at all read my previous review, I was wrong. I uninstalled and installed again. Now the game runs smoothly. Even though there are low numbers you just need to be smart at put it with the correct numbers. It isn't identical to the ad but that makes sense since the game has probably changed since they made the game. It might even be better than the add because you get coins! I will definitely be playing this game a lot.. This app is honestly so fun. I found it through a playable ad - it was so long it literally let me play until I lost, which is the best playable ad I've ever seen. It made me want to download the game. I just threw money at the developers for an ad free mode partially because the ads were annoying, but mostly because they deserved it. Also, I just got a notification from it that just says \"You are really awesome\" and I thought that was cute as heck", "neg_reviews": "Good game,but lately it keeps restarting once you go out from it. Very annoying as it didn't used to do that before, as long as you still had \"lifes\" it would pick up where you left off. Fix it. Now, with some ads you can't keep playing, they obliterate all your progress. Great game, shame about the ads, not the fact that there are ads, I get that, but they shouldn't delete your progress. Decent time killer. The main issue is every time you reach a higher block they send you to an ad. Terrible set up. Here's your reward for doing better, more advertising. The ads are getting more and more. Open game-ad, start game-ad, do well in game-ad. Finish game-ad and now some ads can't be closed and just continues to play. Your forced to close the game to get out of it. The prices of in game purchases are ridiculously high for basically nothing. This game is an ad for other games. Avoid it. Don't pay to continue getting Ads! I'm very disappointed as i have spent a lot of time watching 30sec ads just to play the game well and get block removals. I have for the first time ever paid to remove ads on an app and there are still ads everywhere. It seems that the developers are more concerned about making money out of every corner of this game and the ads have spoiled it and worse after i have paid to remove them. Its a waste because now i dont feel like playing anymore, i want a refund.. I paid for it to be ad free and it removed an ad from a spot that I didn't even notice. Don't pay the $3.99 to get it to be ad free because it still won't make it add free, it's a waste of money. And the other part is that there's no settings for you to turn down the volume or turn off the sounds. Edit with response: yeah credit everyone back for the \"ad free\" because it's not and there was no fine print. Also stop asking everyone to email and just read the reviews! We're telling you the issues.. Fun game but the number of ads pop-ups is staggering. On top of it, most of them are full length, at least 30 seconds long. I can tolerate a watching ads in exchange for a free game but this is proving to be big time waster. There are plenty of other games with the same concept (with hopefully shorter ads) - so there's really no reason for me to stick with them.. I would have given it a 5 star but it had a huge problem that many merge games avoid , once we get a large number the smaller ones continue dropping. I would be happy if you would change this to removing a small number once we reach a high number. Hope you change this in an update. Thank you. This game has a really fun concept however there are no boundaries as to how many times you can revive yourself so you are in this perpetual state of watching ads. But I liked this game so much, I bought the no ads version for the 1st time ever. This only got rid of the ads that intermittently interrupt the game after you've reached a new high cube. None of the rest. I found myself watching an hour of ads during 1 round of the game. It's super disappointing and I'm trying to figure out a refund.. Ads are ridiculous. It's a fun game, but at least 60% of the time on the app is ads. Every time you start a new game there are ads, even if you choose less coins to skip the ads. Pause the game? Ad. Get a new highscore WHILE PLAYING, an ad will interrupt you. They need to tone it down a lot with the excessive ads because interrupting the game to advertise is gross. I have to take breaks from playing just to get away from constant ads.. TOO MANY ADS!!! .... downloaded the game, pressed start, and... AD!! ... SERIOUSLY!??! Before i even start?!? Then you play a level, and you get an Ad in the middle of playing a level. Of course there are ads to start the levels with items and ads to increase points. Ugh! If you like watching ads, then this ad watcher, i mean game, is for you. Continually crashes and over heats tab. lots of ads, which is to be expected for a free app, however after most ads the game crashes and has to be reloaded, half the time saving progress, many times restarting the game. Not worth it when there are many if these types of games. Downloaded a different merge game, runs no problem. Deleting this app after less than 24 hours.. Horrible!! First off the game is way different compared to the ad, I find the ad wayyyy better as a game. Secondly, the numbers are super small (like 2) so it's very easy to reach the top. And lastly, it's very easy for your finger to slip and make the number slide to a different row rather than just clicking the row you want it to go to like the ad. This is honestly the biggest dissapointment of a game. 1 star! And the creators should really make the game have more similarities to the ad!. While dropping the numbers it doesn't fall in proper place we want in. The line or block where the number is suppose to fall is missed n falls on other side as problem is in the app. Management should look in to the matter as not able to play and I love to play this game.. It's an okay game, but the advertisements are really aggressive. Before and after is fine enough, but they show up randomly in the middle of the game, plus there's random bonuses that pause the game and ask if you want to watch an ad for extra coins, it doesn't matter what you pick you'll still get an ad it just changes whether or not it's skippable. It just breaks focus too much for a concentration game. It s*cks to have to make a bad review, but here it goes: the game is fun; HOWEVER, after playing it for a while and giving it as many chances as I could, I noticed that at a certain point, when your score is high, the game itself acts oddly, like giving you numbers to drop that will obviously lead you to make a mistake, so you will have to use your coins to get rid of the unwanted big number above a small number or else you will hit the top and have to start everything again.. This game has the potential to be something nice. But, the adds man, the adds. I opened the game for the first time, press the start button, and immediately get thrown an add. I decided right there that I'm not going to play a game that immediately throws me an add before I even did anything. I don't even want to know how the rest of the game looks like with adds. What a shame :-(. I used to enjoy playing. I don't mind the ads as I didn't pay for the game. However, after the last update nothing works correctly. It freezes because of ads. You no longer receive bonus coins for watching an ad (you watch the ad for the bonus coins and the game either freezes or it doesn't reward your coins). I will be uninstalling the game.. The number of Ads are ridiculously high and many times they take you to the Playstore even without clicking on the download link. I purchased the \"ADS FREE\" and the transaction was done twice! I request the Game owners to refund one of them. To make things worse I still get ADS at every step towards the start of the game!. I stupidly paid for no ads but still have annoying ads. You get one life and if you want to continue then have to watch ads or use coins, which is impossible when you haven't got enough coins. This is why I paid for no ads, I thought it would at least give me more than one life but there is no difference than before I paid for no ads. Is this a glitch and you can rectify? If not I want my money reimbursed because it is misleading!!. Kinda fun...when it works. This game has a massive amount of ads to try and get you to download other games. It actually tricked me into downloading one by claiming there was an update for this game. When I clicked for the update, a very similar game popped up and I downloaded it by mistake. When you try to close out of the game ads, practically every time it opens the Play Store instead. Very frustrating.. I'm going to start by stating that I don't mind ads in games. I play about 4 different games where I purposely watch extra ads to get little bonuses. This is the first time I encountered an app that forces an ad on you immediately after to open it, even before the menu screen. I've seen reviews on other games that their ads are 'pervasive,' but those are nothing compared to this. The ads are legitimately pervasive to the point of not wanting to watch extra ads for more coins/extras.", "pos": "Negative reviews for Drop The Number\u00ae : Merge Game mainly highlight the issue of excessive ads, frustrating the users. Purchasing the no ads option removed even the ads for earning free coins, leading to repetitive purchases.

Especially during the 2020/21 pandemic, it's still a process, and I've learned to reduce my debt, build up my FICO score, manage credit. I would recommend this app to help you get out of debt, build your credit score, rebuild your creditworthiness. Update: I really appreciate this app. Because of this app my credit score is slowly going up because I'm actually learning more about credit and even getting credit!!. Great App. Only unfortunate thing is in order to get the full experience and this app actually be useful, you have to subscribe to it and pay a monthly fee of $29.95. pretty high for a monthly credit synapsis in my opinion. But you do get access to all Three Major Credit Reporting Bureaus and Experian Boost!to help improve your credit score, but I still think their monthly subscription is too high, especially during this \"pandemic\".. Keeps track of one my three credit scores for free. I use this app to track one of the three credit bureaus. They are not all the same credit it scores,but they are a few points off. That's normal since the three seem to use your information and do different calculations. Its true that places you want to borrow, like banks, mortgage companies, car dealers even cc companies use different ( one of the three) credit bureaus. So its important to track them.. This free app works! I've had it for over 5yr. The update took time to get use to; but it's better than the old one. My credit rating as well as FICO score is shown! It has links to Transunion & Equifax; but I'm not paying extra for their reports. The ability to see my credit score from all three is good enough for me. I also like, when enabled, the popup notifications anytime there's an impact on my credit score (positive or negative)! Plus there are tips to improve credit score.. this app is good It's very easy to use it keeps me pretty up to date. Only problem I have found is my credit score has been pretty low but it's slowly getting back to normal but the boost feature does not seem to find my wireless or internet bills that I've been using for quite a long time now which I know would help my credit score. All in all though not bad gives you a good ballpark idea and tries to help you match up with credit cards that are within your reach or loans with higher interest.. First, just a quick note to anyone using the boost feature. It will only detect payments made with your actual bank account number (payments with debit cards, bank credit cards) are not utilized. This app is GREAT!!. Shows me everything I need to know. The free version is perfection. I get my other scores from another app. Ok the other isn't exact all the time but since all I need is a ballpark figure I am very happy.. This app helped me better understand how your crdedit score is calculated. My credit score went up over 100 points and is on track to reach 789 ( excellent) in a few months...Since using the tips and information on my profile.. It puts together your \"credit profile\" with credit score, income, total debt by category, income-to- debt ratio etc so you can have control and be better prepared to select a bank for a loan, car loan, mortgage etc.. I'm very happy with the app again. The alerts section which is a very important feature has been put back in the top right corner. It no longer shows up in the upper right corner which was super useful. Now, in order to have to look at the alerts you have to clickon the bottom right corner where is says \"more\" and then you can click on the alerts section to see this very useful very important feature of this app. They've made it an additional step to be able to get to it. I really enjoy this app, but I think it could be a good idea if you stop sending credit cards promotions recommended for us. Once we apply and get denied because we trust you; not only we get inquiries in our credit, but you don't look so good if for your recommendation we get turn down. What is the point? So far it is working \ud83d\udc4d great! My score changed, but I can't find out why. Thanks. This app has been a life-saver! I was easily able to improve my credit score by getting rid of fraudulent reports, obtaining all 3 credit reports, and utilizing the \"Experian Boost\" option. It's easy to use and helps me monitor my credit. They even alerted me immediately when someone tried to open a bank account in my name that wasn't me. I called the bank and put a quick stop to that! I wish all 3 credit bureaus offered such an amazing service!!. I trust Experian. My data is secure and I enjoy the free access option. I also like the option of having access to all bureaus in one place as a plan of choice. I also like that I get notified when new activity is posted to my account. This allows me to monitor my account from fraudulent activity. Lastly, I like the credit card offers. I've gotten a couple of credit cards through their secured website. Thanks, Experian for assisting me in my credit health!!. App is easy to use. Navigation is intuitive and the design, look and feel make it comfortable when using on a mobile device. The information provided is detailed and easily to follow on both large and small screens. Comes in very handy when on the go and an alert is received which requires prompt attention. Because of this app, I have found myself checking my credit more frequently since it is so easy to use and readily available.. A great way to help build, monitor, and see where you rate according to your credit score. A 7 day trial (free) to see all 3 credit reports in one place. Don't forget about Experian Boost, which generally increases your credit score for doing normal behaviors.. Why not get rewarded for bills you pay on a regular basis, cell phone etc.? A marketplace for credit cards, personal and auto loans plus many more helpful tools. Easy to navigate, lots of benefits regardless if your score is low or high.. I always recommend this app because it gives acurrate credit scores, since it's directly from a Credit Bureau company. I work for the Credit Union industry, and credit tracking is very important! Nothing better than to have it at your disposal when ever you need it! It helps you simulate scores, credit boosts for paying bills on time, and gives you a breakdown of your information or how many points you have gained or lost. I love this app and never get tired of watching my credit increase. Helpful for checking score and security. Has an easy, straight-forward interface. I'm glad I use it. 1/20/22 I've raised my rating from 4 to 5 stars today. This app has been so helpful this past year or so! By paying close attention, I've been able to raise my FICA almost 100 points! Surprisingly it is (still) the free version! Now I'm REALLY glad I use it!. Great App, Awesome Service! Gives me an accurate update of my Credit Score and far better app and service over Credit Karma or other similar apps. This has helped me make better decisions about my credit and usage. The free version is great, but if you can spring for the monthly subscription and follow all 3 major reporting agencies, it's well worth it. I've gone from a 420 to now being in the process of purchasing a new home for my family and starting a new business venture.. The last issue was fortunately corrected, and I have at least been able to get a reliable score that's at least close to the actual scores that I have, unlike others that are dismally lower, which I suspect are an attempt to get me to utilize one of their proposed programs which benefits them, since they were the source of my patronage should I use it. This doesn't do that, and I appreciate that.. Hands-down amazing app definitely get amazing credit boost based on the stuff that she use. I love the fact that it tracks your cell phone usage everything like that. I am definitely sold and I definitely get it it's worth it and they even have an option for you to pay to see all three which is also worth it, don't have to but if you need it it's there and you can even lock your credit profile. Thank you Experian my credit already gone up.. Gives me accurate and up-to-date information on the 3 major credit agencies, allows me to lock (and unlock) my accounts so that nobody can access my info unless I authorize it, provides tips & recommendations on how to improve my ratings. Excellent service - I've had this for @ 5 years and I can't imagine being without it, this provides so much peace of mind.. Great app! Useful reminders, tips, and notifications. Nice being able to get alerts, see the progress on my FICO score, and the credit lock feature is outstanding. The Credit lock saved me from getting 2 hard inquiries when I was looking for a new vehicle. Some dealers just don't listen, or care about people. Thanks for saving me a headache, Experian!", "neg_reviews": "Overall, the app is ok. The issue I have is that every single time I try to use the boost tool, it never loads. I have tried it on the app numerous times, on my computer, using different browsers, and I get that same annoying e with the shapes circling it. I NEVER, EVER loads!!! How am I supposed to use the main feature of this app, the feature that you are constantly advertising, if it NEVER loads. I have moved beyond annoyed to just fed up. Please fix this!!!. HORRIBLE experience with this app. I've been using it about a year, following all of the suggestions to presumably raise my score. NONE of the utility bills that I've paid through my debit card have raised my credit score. But that's not the worst. This app told me that my FICO score increased to 600, and today i went to a local car dealership to inquire about a car loan and they told me that the FICO score that they had was 495. That's a 105 point difference. I was EMBARRASSED!\ud83d\ude21. The app was working fine for the 3 months of payments necessary to use boost. But lo and behold as soon as you get your 1st boosts your bank accounts and credit cards used to pay bills mysteriously become unlinked. Good thing I didn't waste money on a paid membership. Credit Karma is much better and is actually reflective of your real credit scores.. The app is okay. The services offered are predatory and information being used is inaccurate. I paid for the premium subscription in order to view daily, up-to-date information as the app's description advertises. As of today's date, my Experian App's information is 33 days out of sync with reality! I have had several accounts more than 60 days out of sync on a regular basis. No day of the month discrepancy can accounts for that.. I downloaded the app and was happy the first month or two and upgraded the app from free to monthly subscription. The other day I attempted to log into my account and it would not accept my passeord. Theny account was locked and I was told to call customer support. Well that's pointless as it's an automated sust that loops you through telling you to use a website to unlock your app but you can't reset password or log on because you are locked out. I have never see such poor customer service.. Just a scam to get you to pay a monthly fee for other services. I had this app for less than a day and got no less than 5 emails urging me to sign up for monthly services. Along with notifications telling me things like, the funds in your bank account are low. I don't need Experian to tell me that I'm poor. It can't (or won't) even give me my credit score. I suppose it might if I pay them $20/month. Thanks, but I'll use a different service.. Uninstalling. Too glitchy to be useful. I have to reconnect my bank card every morning (literally). And app barely loads, even with all the constant updates. It's has great info for building your credit, and has been extremely helpful in that regard. But it's also so glitchy that it's frustrating. I can't update my banking info... it's days behind being accurate. The app suggested several credit cards but now that I have the cards, I can't add them (can't find the cards in the list available).. I cannot lock/unlock my credit without purchasing a $20 monthly charged packet. Since by law individuals are to receive that service free of charge there is something wrong with this picture. Both Transunion and Equifax have apps that are easy to use and user friendly. What makes it even worse is that several months ago, before the new law to receive the freeze/lock free of charge, I paid Experian their fee to lock my account. I see on this app that apparently it was never done.. Went to out a credit freeze in my account thru them, the other 2 you can do it over the phone, but NOT with this company!!! It gives you a website to do it at, that doesn't work and since they shut their phone's down early, you have No Other options but to call the next day... The other option is to write them. Really, have we gone back to the 90's??? For something as important as a credit freeze, you'd think you wouldn't have to jump thru so many hoops!! Funny, here's Another one of their ads!!. Kinda stupid, and redundant. They spent a lot of time making the app look beautiful but don't really offer anything unless you pay $30 a month. When you download the app they make it seem like you will know everything that is atleast important about you credit but NOPE. After you type in all your info they smack you with a $30 a month offer or you get nothing. Oh! and they offer a free trial, guess what?? It says \"pending\" after you sign up and so they don't give your your credit score.. Update: Still an issue since 2018. You're out of compliance. Each credit bureau must set up a online way for consumers to request credit freezes. You are still trying to charge people to \"lock\" their credit and have not set up a way to freeze online with a one day response time. The other credit bureaus have complied with easy to use apps to do this. You should follow suit and stop charging to do this.. Probably a bug - Changed devices. Trying to get into account via password rest and it says \"Invalid, can't connect to server\". Tried forgot username, getting invalid credentials. (I'll update my rating if experience improves on the app} - When it worked, it was an ok app. Does what it says it would do. Check EXPERIAN score. If you want to check the other bureaus, then you pay a monthly fee. At least you can see one bureau for free.. So, got the app a little over 2 weeks ago, it can't verify my banking info (I use a small local bank so that's kinda to be expected) but then it emails me with obviously fake spending numbers as a \"newsletter\". Almost daily. And none of the numbers add up. It can't pull my FICO score, which aside from the boost, is apparently the only thing it could be good for over credit karma. If its unable to do the \"boost\" thing properly, then I will probably wind up deleting this app. Potential scam. Loved it!!! Was great at first but for some reason it won't add certain bills, had to remove my bank account after an app update & now I can't get it to add back ... it's useless at this point, Customer Service is non existent can never get through to an actual human. It would be great if you could add your bills manually can't do that either.. I keep having sign in problems. I have had to change my password 3 times. I changed it last night. Got in fine a minute ago, when to log back in after closing out and it's not accepting the SAME password. I have even tried all my other passwords just in case and retyped the known password 3 times. I'm getting very frustrated with this app. I didn't pay 20 bucks a month for a service I can't use.. The app is user friendly, but with the boost to your credit score, well that sucks. It took me 2 weeks to finally add a bank account to their site, then they didn't recognize any boosts in that bank account. I have had this bank account for 7+ years with direct deposit and all my bills are paid on time. Somehow the app cannot find the bills paid in the account. Either fix the app or get rid of the boost portion all together. Sep 27th 2020 update-- The boost is still worthless!. Frustrated that I am paying for this app. It states my new bureau report is available, but does not refresh or show the updated info. Considering canceling my subscription, since I can get a free credit score updates from any of my credit carriers. It's nice to have all in one place, but not worth it if it doesn't work! EDIT TO ADD: I have the latest update installed.. Whatever you do, don't use the boost feature. I added my utilities, cell phone etc. and though it boosted my score by a couple of points it hurts your debt to income ratio. This feature caused just enough of an issue to not get approved for a land loan. I have removed the utilities and once they come off my lender will approve the loan. DONT DO IT!. This app sucks, it will not show your credit score, when you contact tech support they tell you to empty cache, delete and reinstall, after all that, you still cannot see your fici score, don't waste your time! I pay my bills on time every month, balances decrease every month, negative items fall off but my score doesn't change. 2/11/21 The app just doesn't work. Every time I try to login, it pulls up the loading icon, and that's it. Switch apps, close and retry, and same thing.

I also highly recommend this game for kids because when you're at max speed it's not really that fast pace unlike Subway Surfer, Sonic Dash and other endless games are extremely fast pace the longer you play.. This is the best game EVER!!! My favourite hero is Angela, also my favourite place is on the jungle(the last place). But there is 1 problem, when I always use wi-fi, there will adds in a minute\ud83d\ude12 and can you like add becca? Because I want to know how becca looks like when she is a superhero and also her power. But again this is the best game ever. Thanks Outfit7.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. i saw tom t pose insta 5 stars.But really though,this is a very great game,it's addictive and most importantly fun! But I do have a couple issues.1:Sometimes my swiping won't register but it's fine.2:SO MUCH WAITING.I mean hey its not levels of Dragon city waiting...cough cough dragon eggs taking 24 hours cough cough.Other than those issues it's very great! Also I would kinda like it if you needed to defeat a boss in a certain way like the little shorts on youtube.But other than that great game.. This is one of the most coolest games ever!! Aside for the fact that instead of using normal characters these are superheroes! And they don't just run but also fulfill quests and there's more costumes to collect, not to mention there are more than 3 characters and places to visit. I love it. But pls avoid too much ads.. It's a surprisingly good game, I'm not experiencing any of the problems that the other players are experiencing like the lags, or app crashes. I play this game mostly 'cuz my 2 y/o daughter loves Talking Tom characters especially Ben so I played it to unlock Ben. There are ads but the rewards from watching are actually worth it. I just unlocked the jungle stage, all characters and their costumes, without spending any amount. I just hope that you add additional stages and costumes. Still 5 stars.. Thanks for changing the add thing! This is my favourite game!!! This is for all ages! 1second to 19346 million centuries or infinity number!!!! I love ALL outfit 7 games and one day, I'm going to collect all of them!!! Every Single One!!!!! If anyone, ANYONE ever says \"Oh no! Why'd I install this?\" Or \"I hate this game!!!\" Don't listen because, l Iove this game!!! So great... It feels satisfying to fix citys and also rescuing ALL OF the others, this game is great! Should get infinty stars...! \ud83d\udc08. thus game is sooooo good! I really love it and so does my grandad who actually recommended it to me in the first place. I love the whole action but also kinda like customisation with the way you get new characters save the world's and get new suits. 1 request, please could you possibly add some sort of daily reward system because I think that would just make the game a bit better. I love this game .\ud83d\ude19 It may have some mistakes .\ud83d\ude08 But the mistakes can be corrected .\ud83d\udc4d I thank the game developers so much .\ud83d\ude0d And there are some mistakes so plz correct it .\ud83d\ude1d This game makes my device battery very low but this game makes me feel happy so if I have a charger i can really play this game .\ud83d\ude09 I love it so plz install it .It's fun .\ud83d\ude00. This is very nice game,at it has a good adventure and the level easy and some one is that it has many add then switch of your internet,then your problem is solved.any vase this is a nice game I liked it very much \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42. Thanks. It is a good adventure game this game is really nice . Someone says that there is problem at installation but thats your phone problem .it is very easy to install and update .nice and super game. Best endless run android game ever that I've played so far! What makes it great is that you're not only running and dodging obstacles, but you have power ups like the lightning bolt to burst through enemies and obstacles. I also like how you beat up bad guys along the way. The only thing that needs to change is the placing of the upgrade chamber. It takes me away from the action when I go into it.. This game is amazing, it was fun playing it. I really liked Tom's style. It's So Much Better Than Subway Runner Thank you. \ud83c\udf08It is the best game I have ever played. Graphics are so good and controls are so smooth\ud83d\ude0a. It is not like ordinary games it is different and that's why this game is best\u2764. Very happy to play this game and waiting for the new updates \ud83c\udf20\u263a\ufe0f.. I think its an excellent game. I havent experienced that many adds. But if you need to buy something that's when you choose the adds. Honestly its a good game, because I only download games that are good. So it's amazing and I recommend it to everyone \ud83d\ude03. try to download it but it's just showing cancel then I tried it in my tab and the best game ever just showed up in front of me love it\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 and I especially love the costumes tanks. Exiting game I ever played and it is wonderful. But watching the video is some times opening and some times not opening. Otherwise it is awesome. It's a really nice game there's just one problem, When all of the coins come because of the magnet obviously, the bag doesn't come but l think l know why because a bag is like well... you know, but this is a game not real life so as any other games, so yeah other than that it's a nice game so yeah.. Very cute and adorable game. It had many veriations in outfits. This game is very nice to play when you want to pass time as well. But it would also be nice to get new worlds, or new levels. And maybe new charcters if it's possible.. It's a nice game cause you can collect avatars by playing the game and this is best that it is not in app purchases and I love this game very much I'm so happy with this game.\u2661\u2661\u2661. Cool and nice game, but the problem is that it doesn't matter whether i make 2 million score or 10 score, they never give me anything on next highest score. Moreover, it is difficult to unlock things by playing the game, becausw it doesn't matter how much, and how better you play the game. You musy give some gems to user if he or she scored somthing good", "neg_reviews": "My daughter enjoys this game s lot and is very good at it. Better than me. Low rating is simply because I bought her a new tablet and the game is making her start over. She has put a lot of hours into this game and I have actually spent money on it and there's no option to continue her game from her phone to her tablet? That is a huge problem.. This game is nothing but ads. You dont even have to play the actual game if you're willing to watch ads for the rewards. And don't be fooled by the 'any purchase removes ALL ads forever'. It just removes the banner at the top and the ads that pop up EVERY time you switch screens. ALL the other ads are still there including the 'ad' button on the home screen that you can tap to see ads for other games that are purely ad servers.. When I download it I fell tired because it takes very much time but then I fell that it is a fun but when I download it it is easy but I did not like this game due to adds and technical problems. I do not like this game and hence I am deleting it. I don't like this game at all. Thanks. Y'all should find a solution to the persistent and consistent stopping of this game. It is sooo annoying and Gawd! I have deleted and downloaded this game many times and it still gives me the same problem. What's so painful is that this game is actually great but this glitch makes it no fun. Please solve this problem, i'd like for this problem to be solved very soon soo... \ud835\udcab\ud835\udcc1\u212f\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udcc8\u212f~. Now it wants to view ads! I HATE THIS GAME!!!!. This game is complete garbage. It is always glitchy and slows down my device. And EVERY SINGLE TIME I play, I am unable to even move. I can only just keep running automatically until I run into something and die. Plus, this app always kicks me out too, after it kicks me out, my phone freezes and cannot do anything, it can't even power off either! So then the only other option is to wait there stupidly until it runs out of battery. I got notifications that the game CHANGED MY PASSWORD!!! OMG!. I love it \ud83d\ude0d but it has a few issues. First, whenever I'm running the app randomly hangs,freezes and closes. Secondly, whenever I'm online the app hangs and also closes and during a run if it does the things I highlighted above it doesn't save my last run. It took me 5 runs to finally unlock Hank because every time I am about to win the app hangs and closes. Please fix this . I'm a long time fan of Outfit7 so please fix the app or I will uninstall all apps I have from Outfit7 \ud83d\ude20.. My child enjoys this game but there is no way to back the data up. So when I switch phones every year, a year of data is lost. Allow full game data backups to Facebook or Google Games please. If not those, then get your own servers to backup data. If that is done then the game is probably 4/5 stars. And it's not just for this game, your other Tom games need a game data backup solution as well. Please do that for us all. Thanks.. My 5 year old has been playing this game for a few months and he came upstairs crying yesterday as an advert kept popping up with a scary face with long black hair, eyes popping out and it reminded me off the scary girl off the movie The Ring. Why on earth is there such an advert on a child's game. This is completely wrong on so many levels. My son is having nightmares now.. This is regarding my recent purchase, it was accidentally purchased by a toddler (my 4-year old son) And we badly request for a refund. It was a big amount and we really need it for our daily expenses, especially on these trying times. Please be considerate to our concern and do have a heart to understand. It was unintentional, he was only 4. We really hope to hear from you soon. Please reach out on us.. Hello This game is very cool and joyful.This game is very expensive for small boys girls and children ....\ud83d\ude0dI like this game becuse its correcter was my favourite like tom,angela another .Its very cool game and I am not uninstall on my phone\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude18. So my 4-year old adores this game. And it said in the purchase section: make any purchase and the ads will be gone forever. So I did, I made a purchase, and the ads still keep popping up randomly. This is really not ok.. although very enjoyable (when it works), the ads freeze and crash the game now. its frustrating when you get a high score or a lot of coins and it doesn't save it because it gets crashed. fyi, it takes a good but of time to get all those couns in runs and get high scores.. Too many ads for a children's game. Ads for everything even a banner at the top. Ads after you die, ads when you open the game, ads in the middle of the game. There isn't even a way to get rid of them through a subscription of some sort. My son loves this game but gets frustrated quickly with being taken to the app store constantly.. Game is fun for play. Even kids can play it because it doesn't go fast. And that is only positive thing about it. Negative. You collect money and gems. They are useless, you can't buy anything for it. Chests? Don't make me laugh. You are always full, you don't need to buy them. Only tickets matter and they are cash only. You can win them but in small amounts. Quests? Lame. Repair buildings. WHICH ONE???? NOTHING IS BROKEN.. This game is pretty good, but the problem is that whenever I play the game it lags so much that it drives me crazy. Also there are way too many ads. Sometimes during the ads my game crashes, and I have to wait for such a long time for it to load!. The gane is very fun and interesting.But the two things that annoys me the most is firstly, the ads.Secondly, which makes me fuming mad, is this:This two days I have been trying to save up for Ice bolt tom.and then after playing it, I saw a exclamation mark on top of the snowflake and then tapped it.There was another one at the 3\u00d7 laser ship one and just tap it which was on the top right.Then I bought those things.I want a refund and will only change to 5 stars if I have my refund!\ud83d\ude20. Went from decent to terrible. I paid to have ads removed and now with this new update i am bombarded with adds every other game. The road map takes away the fun of competitive points, copying every other game with similar road maps to earn and have to pay to earn better rewards. Once you beat the game (which only takes a day or 2) theres nothing really left to do. Rewards chest takes hours to unlock.. My son who is 6 loves this game but I am not happy with the graphic ads! A sniper game showing a woman with a knife to her throat and then the guy getting shot in the head!?! That is very upsetting and makes me not want to download any of these games for either of my children. Very dissatisfied!. This game is too much laggy. Always lagged at special animation that's always cost me the game. And moving left or right isn't work well all the time.

There is little to no lag, and it can be used online and offline. I can't afford premium, but if I want to access premium features all I have to do is watch a short ad. It's great for making short videos and animations, and simply making slide shows. Editing audio and applying transitions is fairly easy, and it's amazing for beginners and experienced editors. I highly recommend this!. This mobile video editing app has all the features one would want to create excellent projects for YouTube. Just finished and uploaded a 26 minute 1080p video and it was a great processing success. The $4.99 monthly premium is well worth it considering all the useful layers and terrific transitions that are included. Also, it's very easy to learn and use. Very pleased with this video editor.. Amazing app, the best I've used on a phone. But! It would make it soooo much better if there was an option to auto sync audio with video for people that record their audio separately. Also, if there was an option to have several speeds on the same clip like that of Adobe rush. Please please take on board the audio sync feature. It is so important for content makers. BTW, love the new update with the ability to change the aspect ratio!. I love it! This app is very easy to use for beginners, and the stuff you get for free is really good! My only downside with this app is, After a recent video I made, I came across a problem where I can't add more then about 9 video layers. And I don't know if this is because of my phone type (Android) or if it's the app, or a update. If it's the app or update, please fix it. I don't think people are enjoying that. (I could be wrong) Other than this problem, great app!. This app is AMAZING!! I always use kinemaster to make videos. It has alot of features. This is a very good App\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 For those who has problems putting a second video, Maybe try going to the settings and set unlimited layers. Maybe that would help. I have been using this for almost 2 years and there is nothing wrong with it. I just gave a solution because while i was reading comments, i saw that one of them has a problem with the video layering thing. Maybe try what i said, maybe it will help:). An excellent video editor/creator software. I've been using it for years and have made some of my best work with it. I love the ability to use a touch screen because when I get into a flow I can edit with some serious speed. Like all software it has had some glitches but Kinemaster usually fixes the problem with the next update. One time they even sent me the installation files because I was having problems. Now that's impeccable customer service. Kinemaster is continuously making the app better.. Very professional tool, free, easy-to-use, gets the job done for whatever type of person you are! From effect, sticker, texts, to all sorts of useful things! Personally I don't think there is anything better than this when it comes to more options, and just the little things in general, every bit or work and effort was put into this. Want fill-screen? Got it! Want HD picture? GOT IT! It's perfect for any scenario! Personally I like it, because I'm a YouTuber, and I need something for mobile.. Great video editing App! - created my first video using this app. It lets you export is so many resolutions. The app requires you to play around with it to understand the basics but there are so many options available. The export function is quick. The only downside I found was when I tried exporting as 4K, some of the video went missing. I highly recommend this app to others. Look forward to making my next movie.. This app is superb for new youtuber. I am using this app for 1 year regular. But, from three to two days I have a issue regarding to my editing. I can't Edit more than video of duration 4 minutes. Please give me solution. Example. I have a gameplay video of 10 minutes. But, when I import that video in kinemaster it will automatically cut into 4 minute video. And rest 6 minutes video is not import. Please give me some solution. I think you will reply me ASAP. thank you.. I have never been more happy with an editor app like KineMaster. Croma key works great! There are alot of in, overall, and out animations for videos which is good. It would be nice to have more layers but overall it's great! It has great music choices even if your not premium. the only problem I have with it is it won't let me put in music from: Music Maker Jam. If this is fixed this is the perfect app for everyone!\ud83d\ude03. Amazing app, I can edit very well especially on my projects. However many features are not available when your not in premium. I can only get premium, by money. I hope you change some features to be free, because I'm a student and also I knew that many students have asking also, that some important features are needed and are not available. And kindly add a minus 1 and 2 on music edits, because it is very important on editing a music. I hope you do this on next update. God bless you all.. This is the best editing app that I've ever experienced! I would really recommend you to use this app for editing. Here's why : you get to use some cool effects , get to put music , get to record your voice and also can put effect to your voice and last but not least the screen is perfect for it it's so easy to use! I totally think u gotta download this if your looking for an editing app! AMAZING APP!!!!!! \ud83e\udd29. Kinemaster, for me, always lagged, crashed, and overall was a very bad and slow app. Any video above 30 seconds would take about 1-4 hours to export and I did address this issue in my last review. However, ever since the app has been updated, it has stopped lagging, glitching, crashing, and works a lot smoother. I was quite surprised. It would even start to export slightly faster. Now, it's a way better app than it used to be. Overall, I would recommend Kinemaster for any begginer.. I love this app very much. Tho at first, it wouldn't let me export the video im working but after awhile, it worked. Then a few months passed, it wouldn't let me add a layer to which it's media is a video. I got a new phone and its working perfectly here. I'd highly recommend this app to the ones who are new to editing. I've post a review before about the first problem i had, and it was easily solved. This is an amazing app!. I'm so happy with the Kinemaster team this time! Well done guys, you've designed such a great app for us editors out there, I'm really fascinated. The new update? It's just amazing as always! Now, the editors who couldn't afford premium in the past, have the option to get the premium access by watching ads! This is so good, I'm so happy, you can't even imagine. I always wanted to put cool and quality effects in my videos and kinemaster made it possible! I really recommend this app! Thank you.. A great editing site for mobile phones (wouldn't recommend on a computer or laptop)! Kinemaster was my first editing site, I am happy to say that it really got me into editing in the first place. The interface is simple and easy to use and can be used for many types of edits, from professional videos to simple audio edits. Overall, a wonderful app.. I really love this app! I use it alot but whenever I export a video, the brightness changes into more bright and it looks a little off. Im not the only one who has did problem, I know a youtuber who also has/had the same problem. I tried to search it up but nothing ever came up. I tried fixing it by putting the brightness lower so when I exported it, it could be the same but I think I just made it worse. Can you please fix it or tell me why this is happening? Thank you. My complaint is the same as many other users. The plus sign is in the way. It almost ruins the app for me, and I've been a faithful user for years. Also the export times are ridiculous. IDK what you guys did, but please fix it. **EDIT** As I read in a reply to someone else, if you go to that small section where the plus signs are, and pinch to zoom or spread outward, you can actually enlarge the clip in order to manage the clip. WHEW! I almost gave up. It's great again.. This app is very good. I often use it for making my videos on YouTube. There are plenty of features (even without the premium version) and I quite like it. It does not contain a lot of advertisements. I only usually see one after I export a video. Usually, editing software costs a lot of money. But this one is actually fairly cheap. It is very worth the price and I recommend you trying it. Thank you for reading my review.. Very nice and very good in editing ...But when you go to any other app or if the mobile turns off it get stuck in one place when saving ...But this app is the best to edit Youtube video's.", "neg_reviews": "I have used Kinemaster with other devices and no such thing as terrible as this has occured on them. But on my laptop, one day i made a video and later, when i had finished it, i clicked on it to watch it before i was about to export the video on Youtube. The video suddenly stopped at 8 seconds through. I don't understand because i've never had this occur in my editing experience.. So I've been using this editor for the last couple of years but when I had the new update, That changed! When I trim or cut a video, it's cutters it at the wrong time and takes me half way through the time line! This is very annoying! I would recommend a different app and I am going to cancel my premium subscription!! I am not going to be using this editor untill this is fixed! Please fix this issue kinemaster! This is so annoying! Thanks, Joel. This app is horrible sometimes, it app crashes so much. I can't export it, images and videos get deleted on their own. When I want my video to get exported, it always shows this big circle and doesn't load. I tried upgrading it but nothing happens, or rather other features get destroyed. I can't open my projects fast and basically this app sometimes is a disaster. I don't know what's wrong with the app but it has never been like this. It was much easier to use. PLEASE do something and fix this.. The app lags and crashes a lot. While editing the video, I'm unable to play the video more than 1 time. It just gets hanged and I am unable to edit anything further. Also, after closing the app, it doesn't work. The only thing works is to restart my mobile. I used to love this application but now I feel that it's better not to use it if I have to restart my mobile after every small change in the video.. I like this app a lot, it's so easy to use and there's also lots or transitions to use. But the reason I give this app one stars because after I finished editing a video it would say \"An error occurred while exporting. Please try again\"' I tried exporting it multiple times but it still didn't work. I spent hours editing it. I also added a lot of effort. That really upset me. This also happened to me twice. Sorry for complaining and being a Karen, I'll just try using other apps or reinstall it.... I was very happy with the app until I tried to export a finished project. No matter what I tried, no matter what I used to play the videos, no matter how I adjusted the settings, my beautiful, high-quality photos were reduced to a low-resolution, pixelated mess. It seems the app simply isn't capable of exporting their supposed \"1080p\" and \"2160p\" resolutions, as they would claim. I paid good money for the premium version so that I could export in higher quality. Apparently I paid for nothing.. There are so many bugs and glitches it's pretty much unusable. There's been an issue today where video layers aren't showing up in the final exported video, when I'm editing it it's all there but then when exported, just gone. I tried everything to fix it, along with many other issues I've had, but nothing works. Please fix this mess of an app.. I'm facing a problem after updating the app....when I'm trying to add a video clip from camera section to edit,it's showing again and again that,\"cannot add as clip because the resolution is not supported in the device\"\ud83d\ude21....And it's happening only after updating the app.Before this it was running smoothly.now I've faced too much problem for this issue.. Please,solve this problem as soon as possible \ud83d\ude4f It's a humble request.. 1 star actually dont even deserve 1 star idk why but i cant save video which took me almost 4 to 5 days for editing i did to much hardwork and everytime i try to save it, it just reach at the end but didnt save its just soo irritating to me....i have been trying it for 10 th time and still didnt get saved please solve this issue...i even tried to reinstall it but again the same thing happen please solve this issue please!!!!. Good app for video editing but problem accurs while saving the video.... Very bad saving result.... I have work hard for 5 days to create a video but when i was saving the video.... Problem accurs again and again. Every time when saving the video. I have done every possible setting but video is still not saving.... Please, Do some work on this... Video should save easily in that type of big apps... I'm very much disapointed... Error accurs in every video not accurs in just one video.\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. This is app is great for editing and all, and everything except one thing is perfect, the exporting. When I made my video, and went to export it on 1080 quality and low bitrate, I had to wait for 45 mins and the loading bar wasn't even halfway. This was extremely annoying, this might not happen with everybody, but it happened with my device (I cleared all ram, junk, and even uninstalled and reinstalled but it didn't work).. I got this app before, (on my iphone) and it was much better than it was now. I replaced my iPhone with Samsung, and downloaded this again, and when I'm trying to see it, it keeps freezing and stopping while its playing. And it asks me to buy premium every 50 seconds. I also cannot add text. Please fix your app. For now, I'm just going to use power director, which is much cheaper, has more free things and easier to use. (Not to be rude \ud83d\ude05). This app is pretty terrible for the longest time I couldn't even record sound and now that I can it takes 15 minutes Maybe it's just my device but if it's a common thing then I don't recommend this app. ALSO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A VIDEO SMALLER AND I'VE TRIED AT LEAST 20 TIMES AND IT KEEPS CLOSING AND I JUST WANT TO THROW MY COMPUTER AT THE WALL. I've been using it for like 2-3 months and at first it was great but just today, I was finishing up a BIG video project and as I exported it, it failed. It didnt say error or anything just went back to kinemaster home screen. I tried clearing out cache and storage, restarting my phone and swiping out of it then re-entering but none of them work. I tried exporting it like 10 times since I REALLY needed to video but it didnt work. Can you guys please fix it in a way where I wont lose any data?. Kinemaster was amazing untill the update. I have no idea what caused this, because I have used kinemaster for almost a year now and I had no problem with it. Anyway, heres the issue - When I try to export any video, no matter how high I set the video quality, the finished product always ends up terrible!! It lags, the FPS is like, FOUR, and the music is off timing. I don't know what to do. Please fix this bug and I will improve my rating.. Hello, I've used to rate this 5 stars but now I rate this app 2 stars because when I made a 18 minute video and decided to export it, The export feature was loading for a really long time that I couldn't wait anymore. In my opinion, I like your old version better. I do not like this update, now I cannot save the 18 minute video I made which took me days and I even stay up late to make it. Please fix this, I don't want it to keep loading for a long time that I'm not able to save it.. \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udca2. I used to love this app but recently like after the update their have been so many problems I can still upload the images and videos I had before the update but it doesn't show the new images/videos I have so it's quite annoying because I need an easy to use app for my yt channel but this one just stopped working correctly. I use an Android and all my friends with Androids have this happen to them so it might just be a problem throughout Android phones, so if it is pease fix it.. For a long time, this was the software I used to make videos, and I wish that it would stay that way, but ever since yesterday, this has become a useless piece of trash that won't cooperate with me in any way. It crashes every couple minutes whenever I try to work on a project and flat out breaks whenever I try to export anything. This isn't a problem with my phone, because every other app works just fine. This is all on KineMaster, and if it doesn't get fixed soon, I'm never using it again.. Not so good I made one video with KineMaster and was super happy with it. Then, I went to the settings to stop it from zooming in so much (I watched videos on how to do it as well.) and now it will play the background music but not even play the video.. update bricked the app, sound unsyncs, can't open projects. Constant crashes. Cant use anymore :/ Been using Kinemaster since whenever the X-Men movie \"Logan\" came out. It's legit impressive what they offer here. Ive had access to adobe premiere for over a year now on my PC, but honestly I'm able to edit videos with multiple layers, effects, and overlaying videos together rather quickly with this app, no gigantic rendering times, the chroma key works remarkable if you know how to light stuff.", "pos": "Users appreciate the easy-to-use interface, variety of features, and ability to create professional-quality videos with KineMaster.

Some character die where others live. The important part of the game is building your character to a hero level. One can write his hero story, and that character should become top game status based on his or her advantageous deeds and Nobel character or demon if the deeds are amoral. After several months of playing E&P, I can honestly say that this game is just straight-up fantastic. The depth of strategy involved makes you think, and the community is excellent. This is a long-style game. You wont rise through the ranks quickly- it takes patience. Spending money is not necessary, but it can help. Hero pulls are random, so no guarantees on high rank heroes even if you spend hundreds. A f2p player has just as much chance (albeit more slowly) as a p2p. Give this game a shot.. There's 3 types of games that I love: R.P.G's, Strategy & Puzzles. This game is the perfect combination of all 3. I loved it so much that I deleted every other game off my phone. Lol. I try not to go a single day without playing it at some point. The Heroes and their specials, leveling system, the upgrade and building system and items are so kool that I actually don't mind spending a little money for them from time to time. It's fun, addictive and easy to play. This game is almost perfect.. There's 3 types of games that I love: R.P.G's, Strategy & Puzzles. This game is the perfect combination of all 3.

The Heroes and their specials, leveling system, the upgrade and building system and items are so kool that I actually don't mind spending a little money for them from time to time. It's fun, addictive and easy to play. This game is almost perfect.. better than most other games I've played. way more detailed than it may seem off the top. yes, there is optional money spending and things take a while to upgrade, but gotta make an earning somehow. way more laxed than other games of similar genre. i personally recommend it, since i discovered have definitely not wanted to move on, and the alliance i found is really nice. it's a game where money doesn't make you the best, have to earn your way, and that's the best part. :). Very entertaining game with all the right aspects of a good game: fun, engaging storyline, build-your-city style, and of course, the timeless \"match three\" modality pioneered by \"Bejeweled\". Excellent game, loads of fun, but be careful not to get suckered into the spending of too much real money; oit's all too easy to fall down that rabbit hole with this one.. Enjoyable competitive timewaster - I love it! For me it's basically bejeweled meets basic tower defense. All the elements involved create an awesome game you can choose how far and how serious you play and you really don't need to buy anything. (Though I have spent about \u00a38 over about 4 months... I like the deals!) The adverts are minimal and optional. I'm a fan \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. I used to really like this game, more than most of the games I have ever played, but lately it is getting rediqulously unbalanced in the war, and even in the tournament and raids. People are starting to get discouraged in the battles. There has to be another way to match one team with another to get them closer to the same size. I am having trouble keeping my friends in the game. A challenge is one thing, but total annialation is not so much fun. Thank you for listening. Please fix the problem.. After playing this game for over a year now, I would have to say it is this game is awesome! From building your empire, heros, & troops to battling in wars, raids & killing titans, it is the best puzzle game Ive ever played. This game is all about patience, you can spend money but its not necessary. I usually spend money when they offer specials. You will get frustrated when it comes to ascension items to build up your heros. But they cant pass it out like candy. They will eventually show up.. I love this game, it can be complicated or casual. Many are upset over nerfs and buffs that recently happened. I admit I have one of the nerfed heros, but I'm not upset about it. Just have me a reason to look at my teams a bit more and adjust. A game should be fun, not simply a \"i spent thousands a month to get the best HOTMs, so i will win\". It was getting tiring to see the same hero as tank in 90% of teams. Just my two cents.. Pretty good game with more strategy than I expected. Some of the better characters seem out of reach unless you spend actual money, which, for a F2P player isn't really alluring, but fun nonetheless. Edit: so the game is pretty addicting. And a lot more social than you might think. Been having issues connecting recently, but overall, highly recommended if you're into puzzle games. Edit 2: I'm hooked. I play this game daily. I'm a fan of match-3 games, which is the engine behind the fighting here. The thing I like about the game is that there's not just one track - you can play the missions and quests, which requires one type of life currency (flags). When you use up those, you can cooperatively fight a titan with members of your chosen Alliance. When you use up those, you can go raid other players. Patience is key re: leveling up heroes. You can have fun w/o spending money if you're patient.. Let's be honest, it's a Pay to Play(Win) game... They really don't hide it asking for $99... I won't even drop that on a console game let alone a phone game, Lol. The game itself is fun, and yes it takes time to lvl up, and getting a 5 star seems impossible without paying. But I did, I got 4 without dropping a dime. I didn't start giving some money till I realized I have been playing the game for years... It's a grind time killer Game. Not for everyone. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. My brother told me to play it because he plays it. It was a little confusing at first on how to use the game as I never really played a game like this before but as I got familiar using it I was able to figure it out. This game does get challenging the farther along you play which is good. Alot of upgrading your buildings helps your base. Training heroes helps to level up your Heros. No cons yet.. I've been playing for 3 years now. Yes there are pop-ups when you start the game. Yes they offer sales. Spending money gives you more chances to get good heroes but it doesn't give you a better chance. Devs are great, content is continually updated. I recommend the VIP pass after level 10 or so for a bit. It does significantly help but not needed. My bf is strictly f2p and he has some great heroes.. I been playing this game for the past few years and it is just as fun now as it was then. Yeah there are item to purchase which I do from time to time but it's not needed to advance in the game. I have no complaints and thank the developers for the new quests and challenges that come weekly. Before you judge this game on bad reviews give it a try you will not be disappointed.. This game is amazin! I only think that the game should offer more free gems I know people spend $ but not everyone. Max out your starting characters and find a good alliance like ours to get with. Also...you can be raided for resources but it's not too horribly bad. Upgrade buildings beginning of game and makes it easier and max levels before the castle upgrades. WE ARE THE \"MAJOR MISFITS\". great crew and utilize LINE CHAT. the game chat sensors too much and is hard to text.. Update: I've been playing this game for years and don't understand why people spend so much money trying to get 5* heroes. I promise you get to play just as much with lower levels. Original: I really enjoy this game, and how it adds strategy to the match concept. I find (optional) $5 monthly subscription a good value for extra gems and loot tickets while supporting the creators, but also appreciate that it's not necessary to pay to play.. This is my favorite game app. I like the balance between defeating enemies, gaining items for crafting and upgrades, and the feeling of accomplishment gaining levels and whatnot. I love that it does not throw advertisement videos in my face unless I ask. While there are options to purchase items, it is absolutely not required for a fun play experience. It moves slow enough that you need patience, and you have to put in the play time. Over time it is very a satisfying game.. I enjoy the game but have spent a ton on it, with some regret. Best to decide upfront if you want to play for free and grow your heroes slowly or pay to grow them faster. You'll never get all of the ascension items you need for 5*s though no matter how much you pay.", "neg_reviews": "Pay to win garbage. Nothing in this game exists for any purpose but to get you to spend money gambling in the hopes you can improve your team. EVERYTHING is built to frustrate and manipulate you into getting hooked on their gambling mechanic. If paying tons of money to compete seems fun then this is the game for you! I'd rather play one of thousands of other great indie games that don't attempt to manipulate their fanbase.. Very unbalanced in many senses. 90+% of upgraded take a sole resource, so I never have that and am always full on the other. There are a few bottleneck points where you're stuck just waiting for something. Overall, decent idea, but horribly executed. There's very little to do in the game except click on all the things you can buy. VERY \"PAY-TO-PLAY\" - and downright boring.. Been playing for over a year. Pretty good building and match 3 battle game. However, it's a very slow grind for f2p and c2p players (Get the training camp to lvl20 ASAP if you are). Prices are way too high. If you do spend I don't recommend getting anything that isn't on special. Still a fun way to pass the time especially with a good alliance. UPDATE: Been playing over 3 years now and still not 1 event, seasonal, costume or Valhalla 5*. The rates are so bad you can't even play the long game.. Update: Jan 2021. The direction of the game is going downhill rather quickly. The money grabbing tactics of P2W is now the only thing visible in the game. Newer heroes are not just better than older ones, but the power creep gap is getting wider and the roadmap of future heroes shows the gap widening to ridiculous levels. More events have rolled out that are just a waste of time if you are not a whale. Even if you are a whale the benefits of the events are not worth the effort or the in-game materials. ------------ Here's what you need to know before getting in to E&P. The game is geared towards Pay to Win and sliding towards Pay Just to Have Fun. There are ways to maintain an account with the freebies earned through game play. I've got a whale account and a Cheap to Play account. The difference is like night and day in terms of competitiveness. If you ever see yourself becoming a serious player you will have to spend in the thousands of dollars over time. If you don't care about competitive play, you can have fun for about 20 USD per month of various in-game purchases. If you want to just play for free, you are better off not knowing anything about the game and enjoy the puzzle aspect of the game and ignore the RPG elements.. I wrote one review on this already, and I see that it is gone. Like others mentioned, it was a great game once, but right now everything is a money hook, and you need a bunch of those hooks to move forward. That can quickly accumulate to hundreds of dollars per month. If you don't spend, you'll have to play at least a year (yes, year) to get somewhat decent (not good, just decent). No game is worth it.. The chests are bad. Takes us almost a year to gather enough gems to open a chest. Just to be dissapointed. With a charater you can get from the free tokens. Would erase, but i have to much progress. Now i just maintain until i erase. Overall, it is fun. Just a rip-off. And there not even shy about it. Have fun and stay safe ya'll.. This game started out fun, but the longer you play it, the more you realize it's money hungry app with some of the worst offenses. One of the biggest problems is summoning rate for upper teir characters is so low, you will be stuck for months at a time on the same area. Played for a couple years and have spend a decent ammount, but I am just getting nowhere in the game. Probably time to ditch this a find a better game, it's a shame. Costumes could have been neat, but they're totally lame.. Great game, but all aspects of the game are rigged in order to get you to spend money. Might as well be gambling. Wars, Titans, and raids, are pre determined. The boards are always everything but what you need. More times than not, odds are stacked against you. Acending heros, forget about it, they rarely, give anything of value. Very upsetting, but I've put to much money, and effort into this game to boycott it. Guess I have to deal with it, just as they anticipate. FA-Q SMALL GIANT!!! FA-Q!!!!. It started out fun. Now I regret having spent time & $ in the game b/c now I feel obligated to keep playing. But the tiles and the battles are so obviously rigged. They don't even try to hide it. It's not an anomoly when it's 80% of the time. In-game purchases are super expensive for very little. I've totally lost faith in the game & it's only getting worse. Think contacting support will help you? Not once yet. Don't waste as much time & $ as I have. Very disappointing!. Ok, here's a warning to would be players. Don't waste your time. Once a fantastic game, now a pathetic has-been shell of of a game. Nothing more than a money pit. Developers got greedy, only a chosen few can advance, with new heroes and ascension items. This is just a WARNING \u26a0\ufe0f. And the big thing is, when you get a response, it's just a bot response, sorry to hear you're disappointed, blah blah blah. Later friends. Ok, here's a warning to would be players. Don't waste your time. Once a fantastic game, now a pathetic has-been shell of of a game. Nothing more than a money pit. Developers got greedy, only a chosen few can advance, with new heroes and ascension items. This is just a WARNING \u26a0\ufe0f.. I have literally run into a wall. I cannot improve my players because I can't get lucky enough to upgrade my characters. I have spent way too much money on this game hoping and praying I would get better and stronger. Over $60 on this game and I didn't improve in the slightest. In fact, I got worse characters for money than I had. They purposefully give you bad luck in matches you should win just so you'll spend more money. It's a trap. Now, I can't even spend money to improve my characters.. terrible! this game is a PVP game, but it's completely in favor of the computer enemy. they attack 3 times as much as the human. they get to direct their attacks (strategy) your attacks builds their ability to attack. you have a puzzle board and have to match what the board gives and that mostly helps out the enemy team to beat you. just lost my final battle so long!. The game started out good. It was fun and challenging. You could make some progress as a free to play player but they changed it. I have been playing almost 2 years. I always used the VIP pass ($5 a month). I made good progress with getting 5* heroes. Mostly 4* but still good. Then they changed a few months back. No longer am I getting any 5* and very few 4*. I haven't seen a Legendary hero token in months. It's getting to the point I'm about to stop playing if it keeps going like this.. Used to be fun and entertaining, now just increasingly boring and a chore. The developer keeps releasing more and more content, but the quality of the content is below par. In particular, there is an apparent power creep with recently released legendary heros, and to maintain competitive in this game essentially demands spending huge sums of money (thousands of dollars). The developers seem to care about one thing only, revenue!. I use to love playing this game, but now the resources needed to build buildings or do \"research\" which is really a double dip of resources that you paid to build or improve a building, is ridiculous. I use to spend $20 to $40 a week on this game, but that doesn't buy you much now. Will play for another week or so, and then leave the group and play much less frequently....with no cash deposits.. This game is a money grubbing trap. It has gotten boring and expensive to play if you're interested in better characters and better stuff. Free stuff is lame and low end, not helpful to the average user. Unless you spend $$,$$$. Continuing my review after a response from the owners. All the new heroes are redundant, chances are slim, spending more money to advance, and there is more ads now, since the game has been sold. While it is addictive and fun to interact with people from all over. This game was a lot of fun in the beginning - Loot was available, top heroes were obtainable - and it still is if you can put up with the constant prompts to purchase and have a LOT OF FREE TIME to spend. I recommend you pick and choose the events you want to play and skip the rest. Many of the new events aren't geared to new players so you aren't missing much. The rewards for trying these aren't even worth the time it takes to play them. It really shouldn't take a f2p or c2p player multiple months to level a single 5* or years finish their stronghold and buildings but it will. You'll know when you start to get good... it's when you can't go any farther without spending your entire life savings.. I like the game. I like the format but it ends there. The potential is there but i have never seen a greedier app game. They do not listen to player feedback. There is nothing you can do to get the good heroes except pay hundreds of dollars. Ascension items are so rare that I have never leveled a 5 star hero. You may have to spend $30 per item and you may need 12 items or more to level. So about $400 per hero. No thanks. If the games changes my review will change.. Moneygrabber. Simple graphics and animations. The game is totally unbalanced. It is easy to understand the company's intentions. You have to pay much money in order to progress. It is not right to pretend that the game is based on luck! The boards are unfair.", "pos": "Negative reviews highlight the unbalanced gameplay in terms of war, tournaments, and raids, leading to discouragement among players. Some users express frustration over the difficulty in obtaining ascension items to build up heroes, which can be a slow process.

Despite being challenging and engaging, the game's monetization strategy, especially the high cost of in-game purchases, is a common concern among players.", "neg": "Users dislike the heavy focus on pay-to-win mechanics, where everything is designed to push players into spending money on in-game purchases.

The one flaw this game has is how long it takes to get another crate. I fill up my kitty condo with them, and unbox them, and then my finger is sore. This is my first time playing this game, I have never played kitty condo 1, I hope it doesn't need wifi! Thanx for listening. Mwa!. it is a really good game but I really liked the previous game a lot so I don't really know which one I like better but it certainly is an improvement so I helped you the best luck in the world that you get a lot of 5 stars with the game but I'm just sending it the support and other than that great job on the game cuz it's really it's a really good game and they love it and this is actually my first day playing it and I'm already on the nine type of cats on cat condo 2 I happy u made the game.. Love this game. You basically just merge cats and get rich\ud83d\ude3a. No real money included, and no VIP. Just check once a day and you'll get so much money, new cats, new accessories and more!! One of my top 5 favorite games.\ud83e\udd29 I would not change a thing to this game. Hopefully you will get it too, and enjoy it as much as I do. P.S.-My fav cats are the siamese and the american curl!!. Its absolutely adorable! I didn't expect it to be so addicting. You don't actually have to pay for anything. Ads only play when you request them for power ups. If you need more gems you don't need to buy with real money, you can get rewards from achievements or do offers! The game is cute, it's fun, and I can't stop playing it. What more would you want?. Great game. The cats are adorable, the decorations are great, AND it's easy to play! The mini-games are fun ways to earn money and gems. I highly recommend other games made by Zepni Ltd. (the company that made Cat Condo2.) Only downsides are the ads and if you put too much stuff on the cats it'll glitch a bit. If you don't mind those minor problems, then this game is for you.. Its adorable, fun, a time killer, there aren't a BOATLOAD of ads like all of the other games! So, I got the first Cat Condo, and I loved it. Never thought that it could be any better. Until it did! Accessories, even CUTER cats, Mini games, and SOOO much more! I could probably write a book on how much I love this game. So fun, simple, and adorable! Keep up the Amazing work!. I love the game! its a great time killer, and its fun for everyone ( especially forcrazy cat ladies like me ). also that its one of the only games these days that dosent cost a Fortune to play, I admit the graphics aren't the best, but there super cute! I really like how you can add accessories to the cats! it makes them look so much cuter! and I like that you can watch adds anytime to get something you need, I'd rate it a five out of five!. This game is totally amazing! I've tried other apps like this before that where quite boring so getting it I didn't have too high of expectations. However, I was blown away by this app and it's exciting gameplay. It has cool features that keep you interested like daily rewards, goals and more. I also like that it is fairly simple to earn gems where as in other games you would have to buy a pack using actual money. Please buy this game it is the best game you can play!!!!. There is nothing wrong with this game. Everything is perfect. The cats are cute, there's not a lot of ads, and you can customize your cats and customize the room they live in. Over all review, if you like cats, get this game. Actually, get this game even if you have a hatred of cats. You will like them after. if not, dont sue me pls. One of the best apps out there! I usdd to play the first one a couple years ago and completely forgot about it, I came back and realised there's a second! It's even better than before and is addictive! You won't regret playing, if I did have any complaints, it would be how long the adventures take, but you g get a good reward for it so its fine. THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!! There are no glitches or lagging problems. The characters are absolutely ADORABLE and they have cute music playing in the background. This is honestly so fun!!! Definitely get this game, it's FREE!. Oh my gosh! This is such a great game! I used to totally hate cats of all kind but the way the game makes you want to get and own a cat is indescribable! Would a hundred percent recommend for all ages or if you just need something to do and just relax. There are like barely any ads so there's a lot more playing time less time trying to skip with exes to small! Theres also tons of upgrades so things are never boring! Moral of the review..great game and would recommend.. A fun game to play when you are bored. Barely any ads! And cats!!! It is very fun to play but it is single player! Maybe you could add a racing place where you race people online with your choose of cat (cats you have) you race as and you compete to get to the finish line with obstacles in your way and coins and gems! But anyways this is an amazing game for cat lovers and kids.. this game is fun to pkay, it has good graphics and good gameplay i thinkbit is a little bit worse than the first game but it is still amazing i hope you enjoy playing this game if you choose to download it :). I am a cat CRAVER and I love cats SOOO much!! When I saw the trailer I INSTANTLY installed it, have had any lag or crashes yet. Very high quality, I just love this game overall, (the music is great too it calms me) PS: I'm thinking about buying the starter pack, but I already owe my family \u00a344 so, I dont think ima get it. But thank you for making this game, also I made my brother get it.. BEST GAME I have ever played!!!!!!! So this game is not without flaws, one why do the adventures take soooooooo long? The cats are adorable but when you try and buy one you've got before why are they so expensive?!?! But overall I think that it's a very good game so download it and be overwhelmed by the cuteness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. It's a VERY adorable game, I enjoy this game alot! I have no experience with ads in this game, even if there are ads there are a few of them, and I love the fact even after uninstalling and then you want to install again you have all you're data in the game, You've done a great job keep it up \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70. I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!! The style is adorable!! I love how sometimes you can get gift crates!! Every time I get a new cat I wonder what's next!! I've only been playing for a few minutes and I can already tell you that this game is awesome!!!!!! definitely download it you like these types of games!! SUPER ADDICTING AND FUN!!!! NO DOUBT 5 STAR GAME!!. So cute adorable! There are tons of cats you can unlock and combine just a few days I already reached a millions of coins like this 3.815M its real so install this game it even gives you money when you want to pause and then come back kaboom! They give you fee money cause you were away!. (WARNING this game is addictive!) This game is awesome, because Cat Condo 2 does not force feed you any stupid ads, and its up to you if you wanted to watch an ad to multiply things, or to get another weel spin, things like that. The cats are also very cute, and I have 0 complaints, this is the perfect game if you want to just merge and have fun!", "neg_reviews": "I have had this game for a week and it will randomly crash. Please fix and I might be able to boost my rating!. the game is cute and fun however i got sick and tired of the notifications with no way to turn them off. They wouldn't have bothered me of they caused unrelated games to say they have some too even more those without any. fix it.. Please help! I can't even play the game, I just keep crashing. It won't stop crashing, I can't get past the intro.. I couldn't even play! It took forever for it to load and when it did the screen would turn black and the game would shut off I am really not happy about this. I had originally given this game 5 stars and a great review. That was until after about 6 months of playing daily and finally getting all the cats, i was working on getting all the accessories. That was when the game spontaneously refused to open. I have waited 3 months, i have emailed the creators of the game, and heard nothing. I cannot access the game and therefore loose 6 months of my time I put into it. I am grateful i never used real money to make purchases ingame. Very unhappy.. It didnt let me play.When ever I load it up it kicks me out.Can you please tell me whats going on.Thank you.. I was SO excited to play this game cause it looked so fun and so cute but when I went to play the game it logged me back to my home screen Everytime. If your reading this then I recommend to still download the app cause a lot of people love it. So try it and download it and maybe it will actually work for you cause it didn't do this problem to everyone else that I know of just me. I still recommend this app just to see if it works!. Robot cats won't merge. Zero help function to learn why. Too much animation- visual over stimulation with no way to turn it off.. Stuck on cat number 29 (roboto) cat. Cant pair them together at all. So far no update to fix it and it's been like that for a couple months now , its so frustrating to get so far but cant go on any further.. I loved this game. It's just a time waster, but a fun and cute little game to play with a reasonable level of ads. I played a little bit every day for 6 months and really enjoyed it. As other reviews have stated though, part way to unlocking the very last cat the game freezes on the opening screen and won't load. My mom had shown this game to me in the first place and the EXACT same thing happened to her so I was kind of waiting for it, seems like a strange coincidence I'd say.. Up until a week ago I was enjoying this game very much. Cats are cute, animations are cute, only have to watch an ad for an extra bonus. I was on level 70 with over 1500 gems but a week ago it won't load anymore. I sent an email to the developers but haven't received a response. If I lose my progress I'm not starting over. Super disappointing.. you only get 1 star because every time I try to play it turns off the game no matter how many times I try to play it never works so please fix this for me. I couldn't even play! It wouldn't load, i tried 7 times. Extremely shallow clicker with very limited mechanics. The premium currency can only be used to provide a miniscule increase. Do not waste your time or money on this very basic game. If you are into clickers, there are multiple other options that are far better.. No Support. Stopped being able to login weeks ago, can't get a response from support after multiple attempts. Very disappointing as I spent money in the game, and the game stopped loading before achieving the last cat. I want a refund if support isn't going to help me. Edit: Nearly 2 months later without a single response. I've emailed them 7 times.. Couldn't get in the game and if I did it would kick me out definitely a 1 star!\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude23.

Absolutely addicted to the game for months. Great time waster. Got to the very end and got every cat, got almost all the colours. My phone then updated and it wouldn't open. I've been trying for ages to see if it would but no luck. So I had to uninstall and reinstall and lost everything. Given all that time I can't give it one star but after losing everything I can't give it more than 2 either.. This game crashed and froze my phone 19 time's when I tried to just open it over all of that it won't load up it's a big waste of time and battery \ud83d\ude20 DON'T DOWNLOAD! and I think some of the five star ratings are fake reviews but I can't be sure!", "pos": "Negative reviews: \n- Crate refill time is too long, causing sore fingers from unboxing.\n- Minor glitches if too much stuff is placed on cats.\n- Some users find the adventures to take too long.\n- Expensive prices for cats when trying to buy ones already owned.", "neg": "Users dislike the frequent crashes and loading issues, with some unable to play the game due to constant crashing.

It gets sometimes irritating that I have to constantly download and then upload them when dealing with speed issues. Other than that, very nice app. I prefer it more than the desktop one for it's simplicity.. Mega, Thank you! Thank you for saving my life's work. I would recommend EVRYBODY to use this service RIGHT NOW! I had a very important Photoshop file I had been working on for months, and it got corrupted....I was devastated until I saw the previous versions feature on their desktop addon. Thank you,again for saving my life!!! 100/10 would recommend!. I like this app slot . Very easy to understand and user friendly. I can't wait till next week so I can upgrade this app . I need all the upgrades on this one , very useful. I don't see how I got along without it !! Well it's hooked me .. no going back to the slow and 9ld way of things . I hope you keep updating this app. It's everything I Need for downloading and uploading .A big thank you to the makers and shakers on this app.\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udf96\ufe0f. Best, free cloud app on the market. Good 50 gb space for no cost. Excellent interface. Been using it for almost 2 years now. I'd highly recommend it. App doesn't seem to even work anymore. It worked just fine the day before, but then it suddenly stopped being able to upload or download anything to or from my cloud storage. Edit: Update fixed the issue.. A great app, and I haven't had any issues at all so far, great work. I have had my account for a while so my account has a 50GB limit. Amazing service and would recommend to anyone. And also, to those people complaining as to why the app needs access to ALL your files, you do understand that this is a cloud-based storage application? The reason it needs that permission is so you can search through your file system and upload files INSIDE the app, without ever having to open your file manager.. Seamless and secure cloud storage with great support across all my devices (Windows, Android, Linux). Only thing that I would like to be improved is the Mega PDF Viewer to add support for searching the document. Otherwise I'd recommend this over any other cloud storage service!. Kept my stuff safe for years, free of charge. I gave it 5 stars because there's no reason to give it less, and when I do need to pay for cloud storage, Mega is who I'll pay. It is hard to complete a large download in a phone browser because they want you to use their app. So, I use their app. It's a small thing to ask considering what they do for me. Thanks Mega.. The best Cloud service I've ever seen is Mega Privacy and it's very comfortable to use. It works so fast that when I get into this Mega App or Mega Account I feel like I'm in the Gallery of my High-performance phone and Pictures, Videos open faster than any other cloud application and works very fast that's why I've been using it for so long and hope to use it all the time. Thank you so much for giving us such a good Cloud service.. I saved to offline some of the files I imported but unfortunately the download dissapeared, can I continue where I left of in my download? I hope you fix this soon. However I will give you 5 stars because it was partly my fault but I hope you find a way to \"fix\" this if possible. Thank you for making this app. Edit: The app has changed miserably I updated to the new version and it doesn't even dowload anymore, it just goes back and forth. I will change my rating upon further inspection.. Been using for years without any issues \ud83d\ude03 whatsoever and is very solid at performing all the tasks you throw at it without any bugs or issues... BEST on the market and well worth anything extra you may want to purchase (assuming you use all your free space).. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED APP!!!. great app for an editor. the quality is always great. something i find annoying though is how when you download a video sometimes it doesn't show up in your gallery, but it does in your files. this means i cant edit it unless i save it to my gallery all over again just so i can put it in an app to edit it. i wouldnt mind this being fixed, but other than that i love this app!. While I wouldn't use Mega as my primary cloud storage (transfer quotas and slower download speeds), it's definitely a great backup cloud option for long-term storage. The app UI is one of the best I've seen for any cloud storage app & you can't beat the cost - free \ud83d\ude00. I love you guys, you are doing very well with new updates i like the fingerprint lock and option for choosing home page. You people are awesome. Only one suggestion: if i have to select multiple image from chat than how i will select and upload that chat images into cloud, because now the days i am doing this manually. Thanks. Awesome cloud storage app with security, privacy and other features that other cloud storage apps don't have. One of the features I like is that it uploads AND plays GIFs, which I found out others don't (at least you can't play the GIFs on the app, while I believe some apps won't even uploads GIFs at all). I also love the security and privacy while being able to share with others and trade with others your stuff. Basic free storage is 50 GB which I love and hardly any other cloud app offers.. Awesome! So many features! I could just use their free services and be more than satisfied, but I must say that I upgraded and paid because this app takes the place of like 10 others, some of which I subscribed monthly. After learning so many features like Mega Cloud, Security that is \"root encrypted\", Collaboration that's secure and easy all in one place, Private and Secure Chat that's end to end encrypted, and so much more not just on the business side, but personal acct as well. Love this!\ud83d\udcaf. As a cloud storage service, Mega is right up there witj the best. It's easy to upload and download, and the ability to sync as many folders, on as many drives as you like, is better than almost any other service. But that would mean nothing without an effective and efficient app. This app does the job perfectly, both uploading and downloading effortlessly, and automatically. A great service and a great app.. Favorite Online Cloud Storage app. It does the job and more! the interface is well organized,. Though, wish the 30GB Free Storage could be extended to 50GB to 80GB or something, because I love to store things online, Photos, Videos, Files etc. It's convenient and secured, Good work!. Dark theme please! Also please add the ability to sync entire drive or selected folders with a local folder, the way you can so so with MEGASync desktop client. Thank you! Oh and, if you guys could somehow fix high dpi (e.g. 4k) scaling for your linux app that would also be amazing. Thanks <3. One the biggest, best, top Cloud Drive service app ever right up there with Dropbox and One drive. It has a clean modernly designed UI and simplicity in it's usage making it so easy to use and service is supported all across the internet on almost all websites where you may be required to download and save your desired files and document. I could easy say that it is the best cloud storage service overall better than the rest that I've used which includes Dropbox, One Drive and Google Drive.. One of my favorite cloud storage. It's user friendly, secure and even free user got a lot of free storage. Totally recommended for backing up your precious files. I hope the developer add dark mode for the app. It'll become so dope \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "neg_reviews": "I hate this app. The app size is too large (but I don't mind this much compared to my other issue). Whenever I try to download a file, it gets stuck at around 70 percent then restarts and then it repeats all over again. Sometimes, when the file is finished downloading, the file disappears and then you'll see that it's downloading all over again. Waste of data!. App is very very large. Please reduce its size. Also, another problem is that large downloads cannot be downloaded through website, or using a download manager, we are forced to use the app for this. Also when I try to download a large file (about 1 GB size), the download is almost completed and then the app hangs and stops suddenly, so that the whole file is corrupted and it is rendered useless. This has happened several times with me. Please fix this.. Ah. I get it now. You must want people to upgrade to the paid version. So you've made it difficult to sync colour cloud folders with local folders. Now it downloads to an all new local folder. In the process the \"transfer quota\" is exceeded. Very clever. But you do realise that this won't make me sign up for the paid version? I'll just find a different service which doesn't resort to this trickery. Dishonesty is not the best policy!. I enjoyed the app very much when I was using the free version. I exceeded the storage limit and was told my data would be deleted if I didn't upgrade. My account got locked so I couldn't download or delete to make space; I had to pay to not lose my files. Now, I can't download any of them. They say they have finished, but when I looked where I save them to, the new files don't show up. They also don't show up in my recent downloads folder on my phone. I paid to upgrade, not downgrade. Please fix. This is no longer working. If I use a browser to sign into Mega, everything is fine. If I try to use the app to sign in however, it won't let me. It just keeps looping and saying that its unable to connect to Mega. So basically I can't do anything with Mega's services since you need the app to share/download. Phone is Xperia 1 with Android 11, May 1st update.. There's a bug that causes the downloads to your device to stop, you have to pause and resume in order to make it start again but it stops again after downloading another 10 or so mb. please fix it. It's really inconvenient.. Not sure if it's just me but this doesn't play videos although WiFi is strong also got plenty of free phone space. Why are videos not playing?it takes so much time to load. the video file is just 10 seconds long!Update: some videos are working suddenly but still not all. most of playing videos have just sound and dark screen! Downloading of videos takes too long,not possible :( Please make it possible for us to zoom in when playing videos for cellphone if not done yet (on laptop not possible). Have been using the app for years, I even upgraded my plan when I exceeded my free space. For the last several months updates to the app have caused it to crash frequently. So much so that it's not longer uploading my phones photos. If this isn't fixed soon I'll be cancelling my subscription as there is not point paying for something I cannot use.. Things you need to fix 1)Can't see the full name of the file/folder 2)Can't see previously downloaded files 3)The worst of all is any incomplete download gets deleted automatically if phone is switched off (hurts like hell, if you have only 1.5gb/day) 4)Can't check size of a folder before downloading 5)Video gets corrupted in \"save offline \" 6)still counting..... Basic version initially had 30GB storage space, now all of a sudden I'm way over storage because I'm only allowed 15GB, what gives? \ud83d\ude21 Downgrading always alienates users, you know... Feels like a total gyp and getting greedily forced toward pay version, I definitely don't need 16 terabytes! Worse perhaps, the 2 latest updates are now terribly glitchy and download VERY poorly. \ud83d\ude12 \"If it's not broken, don't fix it\"!!. Horrible experience overall. First I get double charged(complained and got some refund) App no longer works as it used to. Constantly crashing and freezing. At this point I'm looking for an alternative storage. Once I find one, I'm canceling my subscription. Because of their greed. They can take our money but they can't fix the issues with their app.. Absolutely useless. My phone can perfectly fine download large files through the browser but Mega won't let me and forces me download the app. It doesn't even work. I try to choose a folder to save to and it just loops meaning I installed this app for no reason.. I do not understand why the option to download in the background and show download progress in the swipe down menu has been disabled. Downloads stop everytime I minimize the app and I spend the whole day thinking my download is complete, only to find that it didn't continue to download in the background. It's disappointing. Needless change to an app that was working just fine :(. It works good for a few days, but after a week the app gets slower and slower, and starts to ask you to pay for storage or they'll delete your data. They should not let you storage more in the begging and after ask you to delete, it would be easier if I just couldn't storage more than I have.. Used to love this app but with recent updates it has become incredibly problematic. I have no use for the storage I just use it for downloading because it was stable compared to other options. But lately I'll try reaching a download only to get stuck in an infinity loading screen loop. And often after finishing a download it may restart from 0%. Maybe it's the phone? I upgraded from an S8 to an S20 FE 5G. Connectivity shouldn't be an issue though I'm running high 200mb/s. I dunno.. 0 bytes per second, no matter what I do, no matter what I try to download, no matter what options are on or off, even though my account is at empty quota, it will not download anything for /literally any reason/ and gives no errors or feedback whatsoever. The site itself is working and downloading fine, using this app is like beating your head against a wall.. Mega's policy is if you don't log in to your account within a period of time they will delete the data that you have uploaded to that account. Premium accounts will not have this happen but that was never disclosed to me. I had bad car accident and was unable to log into the account in thier time period and all of my photos and videos of my deceased son that I uploaded the account was deleted The promise of security of my media was promised by mega so I felt no need to back them up elsewhere.. I have purchased yearly subscribtion for my mega account and paid the full amount !!!! Then to why am i being charged monthly. When I havealready paid the annual fee ??? the mail i got from your side about payment confirmation is as follows-------------->>> You updated your subscription purchase to Mega Limited.

I thought at first that there wouldn't be that many fight moves to make (with 4 buttons), but there's a variety of moves, combos, and abilities you can utilize. Moves are changed by not only your weapon, but even your armor. There's always missions available, and plenty to play through. Even if you get stuck on a mission, there are plenty of side missions you can play with no \"energy limit\". The game rewards consistent play, and I'd strongly suggest you get it. \ud83d\ude01. Shadow fight 3 is and will always be one of my favourite games. Everything in shadow fight 3 is super cool. The graphics are gorgeous, but there are some features that you guys need to add. Like the blood feature. The game has everything to be cool enough, however I think damage or conditions during battle and some other features may make this game even more cooler. Overall, I would say, this game is great and to be rated 5 out of 5.. I absolutely love this game. I found it on the appstore awile back and downloaded it and began playing. It runs very smooth and has very nice fresh graphics, but as I do like this game alot but I feel it is missing something, I feel that it needs a friends/clan and messaging system as well as a real time PvP mode where you could fight with your friends and test weapons and such. That would make it even better than it already is for sure, and Im pretty sure alot of people would agree with me too.. The game is excellent, I'm a long time fan of the series. With the last update there have been a few glitches. (1)The animation for a lot if not all ranged weapons is messed up. (2) Sometimes I send enemies flying way off the screen into the atmosphere, super funny and cool, but sure it's not supposed to happen. It would be nice to be able to sort equipment in different ways. E.g. being able to show equipment by quality, showing by faction, etc. Again, excellent game. Can't wait for chapter 7!. To be honest, this is the best fighting game I've ever played. The only flaw of this game is that we can't advance by fighting side quests, duel, survival, etc. The advancement of our character is only through the main mission and that is super hard if you don't spend your money for buying weapons, perks etc. If only the system is changed, this game will be perfect. It's really \ud83d\udc4d. They have been improving. I have played Shadow Fight 2, but I couldn't complete it because it was tough. I have downloaded this game the second time because I enjoyed a lot in this game. There are some minor issues like tough challenges, not enough cards in chest, slots for shadow power for items and there are some others to tell. Overall experience, it's pretty good \ud83d\udc4d. Like the game, like Nekki.. First of all Developers, based on the background settings, music, and character names in Chapter 2, the game is set in Ming Dynasty China, not Feudal Japan. Sorry, had to get that out of my system. ANYWAYS, I absolutely love your game. It's fun, challenging and the animations for the fights are very pleasing. Controls are relatively easy once you get the hang of it. The storyline captures my attention to the point where I want to keep going to see how it ends. Thank you for an amazing game.. The issue has now been solved. This game is totally addictive, couldn't stop playing it! There are different weapons as well as equipments which fit my style. I am now used to fast weapons rather than those spears, two-handed swords. There are even vast type of modes in mission tab. Also the controls as well as moves are awesome! But I think you should improve the level-up system to make sure we get more XP, through missions and others. Otherwise, it's really an amazing game!!!\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29. Really fun! The game seems pay-to-win at the beginning, but it's not. Also, having the AI get used to spamming is a great idea to make it so players need to use the full combat system. The difficulty curves in the beginning are kinda steep, but it helps players understand the combat system to make the rest of the game easier. All-in-all, it's a good game. There are slight bugs, such as ad rewards not showing up, but those happen in almost every game. An incredible experience!. The best fighting game ever. Rival console and arcade fighting games. Very nice graphics, smooth gameplay and challenging. No energy system, so can play unlimited. Grinding for armor is fun. This is a skill based game, so button mashing can never win. Many fighting style to choose from. Very impressive backgrounds and lots of variety to it. Very good job and thanks for making the game.. The thing i like about this game is that it has realistically functional moves in an environment that does not disregard the laws of physics. Well, there's this shadow energy bit in the game which is quite magical...u can call it a fantasy or something. But hey, a little supernatural element is essential for a good action game. However, it's quite easy you know, it has simple controls, and some of the moves of some weapons can be spammed to win almost any battle.. This is the best fighting game on mobile it has dozens of weapons. Armours. Ranged weapons. Helmets. And perks. Everything is sorted in 5 categories. Common. Rare. Epic. Unique. and legendary. The graphics are pretty impressive! And the cutscenes are nearly instantaneous! The storyline is simple to follow but has a lot of lore and mystery if you are willing to dig through it! It also has weekly events and marathons! And on top of it all! Watching advertisements actually gives you valuable gifts!. One of the most beautiful fighting games I have played in a very long time. Been with Shadow fight since Shadow fight 2 released and I haven't been disappointed.Now for the cons. The stability system further down the game is a bit hectic and we usually get the same set of cards from booster packs and chests which is a little frustrating once you get so far in the game. All in all it is an absolutely fantastic game and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful fighting game.. I give it a 9/10. No, you don't need to spend a lot of money to get through levels. If you expect to fly through levels and beat everything, you are stupid. A good game poses challanges which you have to overcome. I am able to kill impossible rank enemies but I keep it to a maximum of hard...don't fly through levels as you will hit a wall at some point, which makes sense. Do your side missions, daily challanges and you will get free gear, even epic or legendaries. Quick tip, epics are better.. Really good game. Game play is exceptional. But I do wish that after your character is shocked during battle, they would pick up the weapon using a combo of punches, and kicks... But otherwise, there's nothing wrong with the game.... Thanks a lot... And why is it that when you install it again, it says \"Error loading game data\"... Please fix it, I'm a huge fan of SF.... Excellent game! The graphics are very decent for a mobile game with realistic looking characters, in fact, the fighting animation is quite polished, and the backround looks very detailed and matching the theme of the chapter and location. The story is immersive and complex, yet still easy to follow and understand. The gameplay is what you would expect if you have ever played a shadow fight game previously, very simple, yet somehow satisfying to play for long periods of time! PTW aspect is major.. This third installment is a massive improvement over the previous. In Shadow Fight 2, new weapons and armor were a necessity and came by once every level. The new system streamlines this and makes it much less of a chore. The shadow moves are a great addition that spice up combat and you don't have to throw away old weapons as they can be upgraded.. Love the game and I think it has so much potential. While many aspects are good, I would have to say there are a few changes that I think would make the game a bit better. One being, I feel like the blocking in the game isn't very good. Not having a dedicated block button makes it very hard to know if your character is actually going to block something. Not to mention, a block button could also allow for parrying. Overall though, very good game and I give it 5 stars.. It's a great game, kinda addicted to this game. For me the difficulty is damn high sometimes, but it's still playable. In fact, I can still carry on without spend any money to buy any booster pack or stuff. I hope the next chapter is coming real soon cause it's been way too long. Anyway, it would get way more interesting if the Duel part is real fight among the players, not with AI. Also it wouldn't hurt if more bonuses are available ;D. Awesome game.. literally the best in its class to me. IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION: 1. No you don't have to spend money to make it, only if you want an extra boost in your progress without the headache to earn it. 2. No the game is NOT too hard, gaming is meant to be challenging lest it just gets boring. Personally I haven't spent a dime and in just a few months I've already built my player to Legendary rating in the duel seasons, and now end every season featuring in the Top Local 100. Just enjoy it", "neg_reviews": "I loved playing the game for the first few minutes, the tutorial showed the controls easily and the story was building wonderfully however after updating the game (7/24) it doesn't work so well. It asked me to reset which wasn't too bad for how little progress I made however after the character creation screen it stops loading and freezes. I have tried restarting the app, my phone and reinstalling but no luck. However, I would still give it five stars if it worked for the gameplay did get.. I want to give this game 5 stars. I really do. The game itself is great when it works, and there is the problem. It freezes...a lot. Sometimes when you watch an ad, it freezes. (bout 7/10 times). When you get rewards after the fight, sometimes it freezes. Sometimes from out of nowhere it says cannot connect to server and guess what? It freezes. Great game but needs a little work on the server side. Update made it worse. Freezes after every match now. Let me know when it gets fixed; uninstalling.. Wanna feel see what a \"pay to win\" title is? Look no further! First the good: it is fun gameplay, honestly. Good graphics as well. Now the elephant in the room. The only way to level up is to beat main story missions. To bad those missions have crazy high difficulty curves. At a certain point, you can earn better equipment to beat it, but those are level locked. So you can't use the better equipment needed to beat the story to levels needed to level up so you can use the better equipment. SMH. Games fun, but it is IMPOSSIBLE to progress without spending money on the game. You could have necessary equipment to beat a boss or a foe but it will be LOCKED because your level isn't high enough; then, how do you level up? By beating the boss you can't beat. So basically, to be able to wear the equipment to beat the boss you need to beat the boss. Stupid system really. Gameplay in balanced situations is actually quite fun. Just a shame it's a pay to win game. Yes, you need to pay.. The shadow fight series is a great example of a fighting game done very wrong. Where the enemies deal more damage to you than to them. No way of progressing further to get yourself stronger. No, you have to keep facing that same opponent or pay up and buy items (or git gud) The original Shadow Fight I was able to beat no problem at all. But this? You're basically pay walling, where you make the AI so hard to beat that it would force players to spend countless amounts of money to progress. Shame.. Decent gameplay, but extremely unstable. Crashes every time I play, numerous times. Ads don't give the rewards they promise. Drains battery and mobile data like crazy. The menu buttons are not responsive, and take you to the wrong page. It often can take several seconds for the buttons to react. Sometimes up to 30 seconds. Happens in fights too sometimes. The balance is way off. You fight like three fights that are very easy, then you suddenly meet a dude who's immortal and one-shots you.. This game is good for time pass but its no more than that. This game wants to trick you into paying with real money. And literally everything in this game needs real money to play. The boss battles are especially the worst......the AI will make the level harder for you just so you can stay and play this game longer. Overall bad impression......they could have easily improved and made this a good game to play. The story is meaningless and it doesn't make any sense.. The game has become so difficult,there is no fun playing it anymore. Specially the events, earlier i used to go all the way till the end of event but now no matter whether you upgrade your weapon or armour or helm or choose a different one ,we will not be able to defeat your opponent after certain stage of the event. So what is the use of upgrade if we can't defeat the oppenent. In every other game,a player overcame a stage after certain upgrade. But here it is opposite,its demotivating.. So this game is a lot of good fun, however it has far too many flaws to be balanced. Getting up is sloppy and leaves you vulnerable, the attack when you're knocked down is inconsistent, you can be comboed while knocked down, the CPU seem to have a better chance of shock than you, every weapon is very slow and the controls are hard to use, as it's difficult to attack when instead I jump away from my opponent rather than attack them. And then the tutorial doesn't include all the mechanics.. Edited my review, I said it was a good game for all but all of a sudden out of nowhere, some of the times it ends up freezing with the music still going on, when I get the game out but not shut down, the music is still playing nonstop too as if I'm playing music on a player in the background even when i turn the screen off.. The game has great graphics, but when you're playing the game starts to act differently, and when the match ends it goes back to normal which I don't like because the game must be smoking at all times, kind of concern about this. Also the loading screen takes forever I waited more than 15 minutes and stayed the same. (And I do have good internet connection, so the company has no excuse).. The recent updates have slowed down the game. Opening the equipment collections takes forever. After winning one duel app gets stuck in the rewards view. No matter how many times I press continue it does not dismiss the view. Only option in these scenarios is to quit and relaunch the application. Rather than making me enjoy playing the game it has become more annoying. Please rectify these things in the next update.. Really fun game. However the difficulty scaling in this game is the most frustrating thing in the world. First round it's always like you're fighting a weak guy. Then all of a sudden he can read your every move and counter you no matter what. In a game where it's basically a more in depth rock, paper, scissors, making the AI read your every input and know how to counter it makes for very frustrating gameplay. It's doesn't make the game hard because its difficult.. I love this game. It's a ton of fun, easy to play, cool visuals, and a intuitive control system. Unfortunately it freezes and crashes constantly. I am lucky to complete two consecutive fights without freezing up or crashing. I did spend $5 on the starter pack of items, which i feel may have been a waste because i want to delete the app every time it crashes.. The story, the graphics including the gameplay are just perfect howeve over the past few months, the game just kept getting slower. Every time you select something it takes years to load. Every after a fight it really takes its time to load. Developers might want to reconsider how often you show your special offers. If players really want to purchase - like me, we know where to look but they don't have to reappear everywhere. And in all honesty, players will keep on checking the shop everyday.. Fun game to play, the mechanics have improved a lot, but the unbalance of the weapons is very badly done, it's more of who hits first, if you start a combo you take most of their life, if they hit you pretty much done. Also the progression of the weapons is very much set, there is not much choise you have to use the ones you get stronger and you stuck with them untill a stronger one comes and then you stuck with that one, unless you pay a lot of money to upgrade it. The difficulty is alwayshigh. Playing this game again reminds me of why I uninstalled it in the first place. Now that I've decided to reinstall I see more issues. Loading screens that last so long. Game crashes. I don't get rewards for marathons/events. Edit: I cannot play the game now. The control buttons are missing. It's been more than 48 hours since I emailed them regarding these issues and no reply. Edit: More bugs now. The controller disappears and I cannot move! Many horrible experiences with this game.. There's a game breaking bug that persisted ever since this last event. I've been waiting every update to see it fixed, to no avail. The bug is the eventual freezing of the characters during a fight. Very frustrating. I've tried everything I can on my side too. Again, very disappointing for a game that I had considered the equivalent of Tekken, SC in mobile gaming. 1/5.. Okay, since the advent of the Transformation chapters, the game has become an unpleasant mess. The enemies are impossible to beat because the game demands loads & loads of resources or gems to upgrade your equipment, which in normal circumstances is impossible to get. Moreover, the stability system is broken, I have somewhere around 1000 more stability than what's required, which makes no sense. And the legendary rewards are always random, never do you get an equipment to fill an incomplete set.. An average game.... But a lot of issues 1. Video rewards glitches. Even after watching the full video most of the time you dont get the reward. 2. Lagging issue: the game lags quite a bit and sometimes it is almost impossible to play. (Using K20 pro, other games are good.) 3. Concept problem: Shadow fight 2 had a great concept regarding upgrading weapons. But in this game all is dependent on the cards you find which is not at all good as it does not give player control.

Good game.It is fine, I am thanking you to create this nice classic slingshot game, too bad I didn't make it to the top, anyway it is okay. New themes every week? I love it! It is fun to play, and updates help them make the game even better.. Super, funniest, exiting and excellent game in this world and the universe \ud83c\udf0c. I really like it very very much\u2764. When I am as child, I played this game soo sooo sooo and sooooo many times. When I am 4 years old. After so much long time and many years later,now I am playing this game.

I rate it full because I think this game is for all ages and makes smiles on lot 'a faces! Try it out! But don't take my word for it! Have fun while even collaborating with family members at the same time! #adoriblyBirdy! Well so I recomend it. Now it's soooo up too youuuu!. This is second best game of angry birds like classic. The game include red.,chuck, etc. All angry birds will fight with with opponent in tornament same as classic and star cup that have challenges. In one of most best in game is have best graphics and spin, events but not as angry birds 2.while this is most has piggy tower where you can play levels it to 110 room is end level.. \ud83d\udc94Can no longer play my beloved game-app will not load. Tried everything (& I'm no newbie). Hoping this will be fixed soon. Playing all of the games since 2009; enjoy ABFriends bc l can either play solo or if I'm in the mood, against other opponents. Love that there's no life limit bc l can practice before l play an human opponent. The levels are random difficulty & each one requires different physics & bird abilities. The boosters help a lot when you learn how & when to use them.. This is probably the best game ever seen. doesn't lag, loads fast, and never stops without reason. The levels are easy to win and the variety of birds is AWESOME. definitely recommend this game.. I've heard about this game for several years but this is the 1st time I've played it and I've done nothing but laugh the entire time. Now I see what all of the hype has been about. It's a lot of fun, very entertaining and not only for kids. Adults, like myself will enjoy it just as much!! If you haven't tried playing it you should give it a try. You won't be disappointed!!. My favourite!! I love the backgrounds, the Seasonal and Festive themes, the peculiar and endearing chirps of the birds, their sometimes unpredictable flights!. I have enjoyed this game for, many, many years, love it still to this day thanks for years of fun, especially when there's nothing to watch on the t.v.set. excellent Game, Love it, thanks!!!!. This game is too awesome and far far better than other games. Enjoying it a lot....and the ones who are facing the problem of glitch, kindly check your internet connection because I have never faced such problems....that means problem is from your side, not from app. AND WELL DONE AB FRIENDS DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPED AN AWESOME GAME!! :). First time my game, i gotta played was very good. but lookin the rewards was nicer. Then, i tried to beating the many players. except the people's score i want to beat em! so addict at this moment ago. Thanks for playing! :). I'm not experiencing any of the problems mentioned in the other reviews. My game works fine. I like the game. Update (1/25/21): I disabled Facebook from tracking my phone activity that is not related to Facebook (i.e. mobile banking, online bill payment, etc.) and now the game won't load. I have really enjoyed this game for a few years and I'm going to miss it.. OMG at first I was trying to download the original very first game. But this one really is awesome! Not too shabby. AND I haven't used any of my extras to help me through the game yet. Score! Highly recommend if you love Angry Bird. Especially if it's been a long time or while since you last played it.. It's not getting Open since morning. I'm not able to play the game. Whenever I'm opening it's showing error. This error http/1.1 400 bad error I'm getting this message when I open this game application today, Toda new game was gonna be updated and I was supposed to get my coins. I've been playing for a while a couple of years,really enjoy the gameplay!great variety of games!still has great variety of games, fun! :-) love it! I got a new phone and it is missing tournaments and games it has me starting at the First level!,I always used Google Play to login. Please Help me!. Wonderful animation with good sound. Good time killer. But I think it should have more levels.. Thanks for fixing of the glitches. I love this game! Play every single day so I don't miss ANY freebies! Thanks! Been playing for YEARS! ALSO LOVE THE NEW CHALLENGES!. Back to all the fun of Classic Angry Birds, with a twist to brighten it up a bit! The new levels are visually fun and exciting to watch, and I'm loving the built-in social feature to bring in FB friends as well!. I just wanted everyone to know that my older brother plays this game and that's a big deal because he otherwise hates mobile device games! He recommended that I should try it and play with him, From what he's told me, He would definitely give it:\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f, I will give my own honest review once I've spent some time playing it, I have played Angry Birds 2. And enjoyed it! - Ok, Happy Gaming!!!\ud83d\ude0e. It's a fun game but it cheats .the bird at the end doesnt even crash anything down it barely hits the mark ..the game has gotten slow theres no crash effect like it used to ..when you shake it not much falls and the tournament game doesnt score right I used to win all the time know it adds up the opposite score really quick and my score slows down ..and I've been in the diamond league for 5 yrs..whats the point in a review.you guys never fix anything or change the games ..whats up slow game", "neg_reviews": "July 2020 update has 500 points and second spin disappearing. Uh, thanks for update? Angry birds friends. Several levels do not behave the way they should. Used to enjoy the problem solving part of game. New giant \"end level\" and pushing you to buy things blocks games, even hidden piggies. If it ain't broke, don't ruin it. Several levels have cleared everything but dust bunnies but score calculation remains low-ball.. Now it's crashing again, in the middle of the ticket tournaments. I will never spend a dime of my money with this app, because all it does is crash. Buggy buggy buggy. If I have to uninstall and reinstall this game, for the bugs in it, I'll never download it again. Some boards don't work, based on how they're supposed to, regarding the YouTube videos. It's not my aim. It's the fact the boards aren't reacting the way they're supposed to.. I believe this game is rigged. I also believe that the developers who have unlimited power ups play among the masses to get us to purchase more power ups. Dirty pool if you ask me. Update 8/14/21. They increased the number of spins to receive more power up opportunities but then took them away. Before you could get 2 spins. 1 free and then 1 for watching a video. Now its only 1 spin with a video every 4 hours. I'm about done with this game. Who the hell wants to be on this app all day long?. Latest update sucks. Doesn't allow you to view ads for powerups. Simpe enough yet a bit challenging. Unfortunately, the game takes forever to load. No such problem with other games on Google Play. It's fustrating to the point where I had to give up. Re-installed again hoping the game would load better but here I am five minutes and still waiting for the game to load (it's about a third of the way there). I had to give up and uninstall, never to revisit. Dec 2020 game is now responsive, a vast improvement. Update.. Dec 2020 once again game not loading. Yuck!. There is only 2 option sin this game. First the tower. The tower is fun for about 15 floors, after that the difficulty jumps from \"this is super easy\" to \"wow, I have to use 14 power-ups just o win the level and an extra 12 to get all 3 stars\" (this is a bit of an egsaduration, but not not by much). The other mode is the tournament. So remember those power-ups? Yeah, they can be used here to and everyone in this game is a money-bags-McGee so it's just pay-to-win. All-in-all: your average game.. This game used to be enjoyable, but now it's just an insufferable pain. It's next to impossible to get and maintain a rank out of the thirties, or the twenties if I'm really lucky. I lose coins in between levels, and it's hard to earn three stars on most of the levels. I just did an update, and now it's glitching and locking up worse than ever. I can't even play the Star Cup Tournament because it just sits and spins on Finding Opponent. When I close and restart, then I've lost a life.. Game is fun when it works. Right now it is very slow to load, knock everything off and get a 1 and not even get 4 coins. This has been happening more and more. Needs fixed yes I will edit review now game will not load instead it brings up facebook bar and says I'm not online but yet any other site I go to is fine. Seriously ready to deleate. tired of the WHO stuff popplng up WTH. This would be a great game if you could get past level 60. Literally there is feedback on youtube on that level from over a year ago stating that when you hit the red button with woodchuck that the tnt does not move like it is supposed to so that it can blow up the pigs in the middle. Unfortunately, this is STILL the case. Clearly the developers of this game do not care to update their game, so I am uninstalling accordingly.. Enjoyed the game until level 60 and then a problem. Probably going to uninstall. Not going to waste money on Angry Birds 2 if the glitches dont ever get fixed. I think I enjoyed the non advertising original AB more. Too bad. ( Just an update , the game still has an issue. I think Rovio is out of business as they have not responded to any support requests.). Star Cup cheats you of entry tickets sometimes. Use 1 but game takes 2. Extremely slow to load. Takes forever for boost to activate. Format really dumbed down. Microscopic pigs you can't see with the green backgrounds and clutter. Pigs in locations birds will never reach. Freezes up. Birds won't fire. Game freezes, won t load. Don't bother watching ad for free boost. Ad runs but unable to use boost as it flips back to ad and lose boost.. The ONLY reason this gets 2 stars and not 1 is because I've been playing it for years, but it's become harder to get 3 stars without using power ups. This means people have to spend money. Money they don't have. Hasn't the developers of Angry Birds made enough???? I guess not! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. upgraded and all of a sudden I get \"connection error\" There is nothing wrong with my connection it is YOUR servers ( server data error consrantly)that are at fault. Stop causing problems and please fix the game! I am tired of constantly losing abilities, cash and tickets for the cup. This game is no longer much good or fun. I think it's time to uninstall this game.. I used to love this game. However I can't play anymore. The only way to log in is via Facebook. So you can't play if you delete your FB and you have to start my progress all over. That sucked but was fine I guess. So I start over. Now there's a manditory tutorial that's 30 levels long. You can't get around it. Every time 8 go BAC to try and complete it, it has completely started me over again. It keeps resetting all progress.. Have been playing ABF for more than a few years now & over the last 12 or so months it has gone down hill in a BIG way! Firstly you make it possible to use 2 of the most powerful boosts on each stage, then you start making stages like stage 8 of the current tournament which are very close to needing the use of many boosts just to clear the pigs. So as the game is turning into a spend $ or fail game I think for me at least the game is finished & as i refuse to spend $ constantly now uninstalled... Well new tournament began today....but same old problem.....I win a level receive the bird coins while on winning screen only to find out my winning coins all 14 are removed from my board. I have warned that I will delete the game and so it is done!!!!! Good Bye Angry Birds. You will not be stealing my coins from me any more!. Game is good but it has a MAJOR bug. Whenever I tried connecting to Fb, it kept on loading for several minutes. Then I have to clear the app from recent app tray and restart, and then, app never starts after that. The app stuck on loading screen with approx 20% green progress bar but never progress more then that. Then I have to uninstall the app, reinstall and play without connecting it to Fb. Next day when I played about 8 levels and then tried connecting to Fb, same bug reproduced.. I want to play this game but.. 5 years ago this game is offline.. But this time online that you should change to offline... Won't load game after latest update.. Only if you want to pay. Locking users from upgrade of slings by giving power levels. You have to earn coins for upgrade but upgrade comes only if you win a level which requires power. So forcing users to pay for coins.

Just so happy with zulily how fun it is to shop there, and the .money I save, I just ordered a deluxe Christmas bed set,with decorative pillows & shams, I've always wanted a set like this !!, cant wait to get it,, I highly recommend zulily. I have ordered a lot of different things from Zulily. great deals and wonderful customer service. if something is wrong with your order they will make it right, every time! l have bought clothes, puzzles, decorative gifts, crafts and games from them. they are a top notch company.. Z removed \"Women's Plus\" and ruined my shopping experience. No more plus size models, so I have no clue what it looks like on me. And I must sift and filter through clothes that won't fit a bust bigger than 36\". Every single item I'm interested takes several clicks to consider: click for detail, click for size chart, click for sizes available, be disappointed and click back to the list. What a waste of time. Now I must use 10 filters that won't even show me everything I could see before.. Shopping on Zulily is fun! Product lines are great, and the selection is incredible. I have not experienced any difficulty when returning an item. Items I have purchased are good quality with fair market pricing. Actually, this website is my favorite. Kudos!!!. Super fun! I've got so many things favorited and the option to be notified when out of stock items come back is convenient. Sales prices can be pretty impressive, and I am occasionally floored by the uniqueness of the items offered.. The app that truly has it all.... But what out because it changes! Who wants to shop the same old boring things at a store over and over?! Welcome to Zulily, where you'll always find something to meet your needs and everybody else's as well! It's a fantastic gift finder, easy to shop by many categories. They offer their own credit card and even billing in bits for your convenience. My only complaint would be the $8.95 return fee for any returns; however, you can return up to 5 items for this fee. Wonderful site to shop for many family items at a price lower than what you find elsewhere. It does help if you know the brands. You will also want to check Zulily frequently as things change often. Have fun!. I have to say that most of my very best customer service encounters are from @zulily! Their IM person chapped my a$$ so I called in. I was M.A.D! The phone rep, Sue, was OUTSTANDING! I am hard to please and super critical about customer service! Sue resolved all of my issues within 10 minutes. If it were not for Sue I would be writing a very different tweet :) They have unique items. The prices are great! The app is really easy to use.. I used to love this app but updated review cuz after a few years of using and pretty much shopping everyday all of a sudden everything I put in my cart says darn sold out? I tried all sorts of products from every store to see and sure enough every single item said this so pretty much useless now :( I had a few items, left in my cart but after that I guesse ill be deleting this app and find the next. Zulily is getting me into trouble!! I cannot help myself with this app! With all the different brands and items they carry, along with the super cheap prices, it's impossible for me not to keep shopping! The items are of good quality (almost always) and just the huge range of products is amazing! I especially love the storage/organization items and the home decor! Great stuff! Love Zulily and highly recommend!. Products come in well packaged. Not a long wait. Product quality is usually right on. With decent instructions and tools to put together. Lots of choices in a product to choose from. Usually good descriptions so you know what your getting. Fair prices. Could have better sales & incentives for frequent shoppers. Questions answered. Haven't had to return anything yet. Thanks. LOVE! The clothing was great quality and when the one item was shipped in the wrong size customer service refunded me and put me on standby to purchase it in the correct size all within a 5 minute phone call! I was also allowed to keep the item that was the wrong size (too big). I highly recommend!. I love this app. I haven't bought anything just yet, but I will say the selection that the app has to offer is awesome. They have every category you could ever think about, and their items are super cute. Everything is affordable. They always have sales going on, and I plan to buy something in the near future. It will be a great app to purchase christmas gifts from a range for everyone you can think of. Thank you Zulily for being awesome.. Back In Love Again. Thanks Zulily \ud83d\ude0a. Love this app!! They're also making sure that they're customer get very well taking care of if there ends up being an issue of some kind but they definitely make up for it!! Best shopping app I've been to!! Thanks zulily!!. LOVE this app!! It has everything. I have bought A LOT of name brand items from Zulily & they are always authentic. I recommend this app to EVERYONE!!!. This app contains the most adorable and cutest clothes for anyone on your list! I especially love the children's clothes and spend money on items for all my grandchildren... This app also sells really nice stuff for your home, work or whatever. Love this site! =). Beautiful dresses and tops. Be very careful though with sizing. Not always accurate. Sometimes much too small and much too long. Adorable reasonably priced children's clothes too. So cute.. Zulily is my favorite online shop! No matter what I am searching for, it has always been discovered here, and the most incredible prices are offered! From food items to trendy clothing, decor to household essentials, or beauty products to endless health needs, there are innovative products for every adult, baby, or pet in your life! And, your home will never look better, or operate as smoothly while purchasing Zulily products!. The app and shopping itself is great but the customer service is outstanding! I have been shopping with Zulily for at least 7 years and have learned that I have the most success when I purchase from brands that I'm already familiar with (search your favorite brands and opt in for notifications from Zulily when that brand is back!). Whenever I've had issues with product fit or quality, Zulily customer service has been friendly and accommodating, and either issued a store credit or a refund.", "neg_reviews": "Since the recent update this past week, you are automatically taken back to the top of the list after tapping on an item for more info. You aren't allowed to keep scrolling. It's super inconvenient. I've stopped using the app until it gets fixed. Zulily the company is great, I've spent tons of time, money, and fights with my husband due to this app. Please fix this guys, I miss scrolling like there's no tomorrow.. Use To Be Better Use to be so much more fun to shop with zulily but changing their interface has made it more aggravating than fun. now it is new today and ends soon but anytime you click on ends soon it's a mixture of the same stuff as on the new today tab. Aggravating. It was much better when it was new, last 3 days and ends today. Because of this, I don't shop near as much. I don't want yo keep seeing the same things across every tab.. Use To Be Better Use to be so much more fun to shop with zulily but changing their interface has made it more aggravating than fun. now it is new today and ends soon but anytime you click on ends soon it's a mixture of the same stuff as on the new today tab. Aggravating. It was much better when it was new, last 3 days and ends today. Because of this, I don't shop near as much. I don't want yo keep seeing the same things across every tab.. Horrible customer service! They constantly mail out the wrong products, then credit your account with the cost of the product only so that you can reorder it or something different. Basically you end up having to pay shipping costs on everything you didn't want/order and arent going to use. They never fix their mistakes other than crediting your account and making you buy more from them. They will not refund to your credit card/paypal and they don't do returns. Do not buy from this company!. Shady... don't trust, buyers beware. The items I ordered were not as described, and you can't return almost any of their items. Customer service didn't offer any solution, but simply suggested i misunderstood in a short email response. Believe me, i didn't, but they must have lawyers write their 3 sentence minimal descriptions that are misleading. I bought baby bibs and baby toys. Nothing crazy. I should have known that a no return policy was questionable.. The app is fine but the quality of products and horrible return process is why Im dropping shopping on Zulily. I ordered a coat, took about a month to arrive, it was thin and not like what I thought at all. Wore it 1 time and 2 of the snaps fell off. Bought a dress, wanted to return it only to discover that I have to return it via USPS. Ummm, I work 50 hrs a week, no way I'm getting to a Post office anytime soon. Be much easier if I could return via UPS or FedEx.. used to be a great place to shop now it's all junk and they want to charge you to return their trash. 8 years shopping here, the last 3-6 months nothing fits, and the other stuff is junk. shelves i ordered the stain was still wet, it was cheap pine, edges weren't sanded and the metal was sharp enough that I got cut. it's all junk. Don't waste your money.. Your app SUCKS for browsing on cell phones. Too often when you back out of looking at an item it takes you back to the top of the list of products in the category you're shopping. It wouldn't be an issue except a good number of your categories have hundreds of products and I HATE having to scroll through them all over and over again to get back to where I was. Not only that, but your items move, so I often miss things I haven't seen yet while I'm scrolling to get back to where I was. FRUSTRATING. You'd better make sure you really want the item because you can't get a full refund. You only get store credit (minus shipping costs) so you're obligated to find something else on the app to spend the credit on. I then found the selections to be very limited. And the ads are mostly for women's merchandise, obviously not appealing to me.. Love the site. Love the prices. What is the ABSOLUTE WORST is that every time you click on an item to \u2764 it or read description, when you continue shopping, you are back at the darn beginning of the list. Makes me super annoyed, makes me less interested in items to BUY, and makes me close out the app. The website is no better. I wonder how much buisness they loose over such a simple oversite? \ud83d\ude44. I have enjoyed using this app for months until yesterday. Since then, it gives me a We Hit a Snag message for every function I try to access. There is a link to retry, but it does nothing. I can't view products, my account, favorites or even my orders! I have deleted the cache, and uninstalled and reinstalled, but it hasn't helped. Please fix this!. worst customer service ever!! they sent me an wrong color so I sent it back and they sent me wrong color again so I called them again. long story short they made me feel and sound like I was a crazy lady who just wanted $10 credit on to account, didn't apologize.i had to tell him \"I don need $10 in my life that bad for u to say that to solve this problem, just have better attitude to next customer\" told me refund was going to get back in to my paypal account but put it back on to zulily account.. I downloaded this app over a year ago and no issues until 6 months ago, it will no longer let me add items to my basket. I have reached out to customer service multiple times and they keep telling me to uninstall and reinstall, I have and it still does the same thing. So i guess I will no longer be a Zulily customer.. Its absolutely ridiculous that you could be on the last step of checking out, just to Have literally HALF your order no longer available. You lost a huge sale tonight cause I just hopped on over to Amazon and bought EVERYTHING that I had originally in my cart. Uninstalling, waste of time.. They need to be more competitive with pricing as well as shipping. It takes way too long to ship. Covid-19 or not... I have ordered with Zulily in the past and they are too slow at shipping. Should not take weeks to get a pair of pajamas and 1 maxi dress. Amazon ships super fast so people dont sit and wonder where their stuff is. Ill stick with Amazon. Tried them again......mistake. I moved and put the wrong address and they would not help me remedy the situation. Lesson learned again.. be very careful what you order on this site because if you have to return things they only give you store credit which is less than half of what they originally charged you & they charge double on return postage. Most of the things I ordered were like dollar store quality & had to be returned. Big mistake ordering on here.. I was going crazy throwing things in my cart about to spend a few hundred.... then it gave me issues checking out. Every time I enter payment information nothing happens... wasn't able to submit my order. Tried the whole process again a few more times but with no success. This was gonna be my first time shopping on this app, after a few hours of surfing through I pretty much wasted my time!!! Maybe I'll check back later but as for now you left me no choice but to uninstall :(. Ordered some clothes from here; most of it is going to be returned. Most of the items I ordered were not accurately represented by the photos/descriptions on the app. The quality (of both the fabric and production) is poor, even for the price. The sizing is way off, too. I ordered small/extra small and the fit is more like a medium/large. Overall, just a really disappointing experience. Absolutely would not recommend. Save your money and shop elsewhere.. I ordered a pair of shoes November 19th as a gift. I thought I was safe because of the red bow guarantee by Christmas. Tracking has not been updated. I do see that it's been pending at my local post office since the 14th. Contacted customer service on the 17th about my package and they said to give it about 5 to 7 business days. That puts me past Christmas but they did offer me a $ 5.00 credit on something else. I appreciate the thought but I don't think I'll be shopping with them again.. Zulily site has became incredibly ridiculous and stupid! Very disappointed in the recent change that now requires you to login to simply look at to browse and look at items. I will NOT EVER login to the Zulily site to look at items or to simply look at the catalog of items. If this is not resolved quickly I will uninstall the Zulily app and never shop with Zulily again.

Its got good shows and movies; very much like netflix but it's FREE, no paid subscription!!! (of course there are a few ads to deal with but besides that the content itself is worth having downloaded and again you don't have to pay a fee) This is seriously the best tv app that is out right now! I highly recommend this app.\ud83d\udc4d Thanks PLUTO TV\ud83d\ude0a. I Love Pluto tv!! Don't know where to start! OMG! it's free tv and they have sooo many channels, some of which I've never seen and enjoy like, the 80's rewind channel. They have something for practically anyone to watch. Some channels you see other cable companies don't offer! The first time I visited Pluto, I said to my son, \" it's the same as having cable, but with more interesting programming and it's free!! Blows my mind! To me, Pluto is Dope!!. This is the only tv/movie app I have found that fits my needs. I absolutely despise tv shows/series. It is difficult to say the least, trying to find an app that has a selection of movies I enjoy, let alone watch. So far pluto has met those needs. Actually, done more than that. I have been pleasantly surprised by the awesome selection of my teenage years ie:the burbs, Bill and teds, the stepford wives. Thank you for being the leader of tv/movie apps. More companies should follow your lead!. this is a good app. i never thought something like this existed. it should give local news station channels as an option, but maybe that's asking for too much. even though it has alot of great movie's old and new. it's very good to have that mix of entertainment... it's a great start for more good opportunities in the near future. for more, an different features, such as( abc) channels with shows that are playing actively an rellivent.also fox channels, an national geographic shows. great job. c. This is the best alternative to cable TV. We actually enjoy this more than what we were paying for with cable TV. The commercials are no longer, possibly shorter and less frequent than cable service. The content is incredible! Love the channel lineup and constantly impressed by the content. My favorite is the geek+tech category. My wife's favorite is the classic cartoons. And the kids love the movie channels. I use a fire TV stick, which allows me to mix the broadcast channels with the Pluto TV.. I have to say this is the best live TV app I have ever seen so far. there is no other app out there in the world that can compare to this app, because it is 100% free. But other live TV apps, cost money, like, Hulu, and thousands of many more other paid apps, but With this app, you can watch 100% free movies, TV shows, series, comedy, crime, it's all free, no credit card or debit card needed. Just sign in with your Google account, and start watching Free TV forever, thank you developers. Wow very happy that I recently found this app!! I'm loving it. But, and believe me even though I'm going to make this comment, it's not meaning that it's not worth 5 stars, recently whether it's live or on demand, all of the shows, music, etc. that I'm watching it keeps cutting off and it happens quite a bit. Other than that, I find this app very good \ud83d\udc4d\u2618\ud83d\udc9c Lately some of the channels I watch are so scrambled (I can't think of the correct word for what's going on with certain one's).. This is awesome. Works great. I dont really like the new update. Changing channels is more difficult now and on my roku I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get it to work again. It's free though so I'm still giving 5 stars. Please add more channels. The Office channel? That 70's Show channel? Joe Rogan podcast channel? Please keep up the work! You're awesome!. Hi , I just wanted to say that this app is everything I've expected and more . You've made an app that really is absolutely awesome! You've made my child happy. I can cast it on my tv. And I don't have to be clicking for the next episode.I've been a customer for years for Netflix, prime video it's frustratingly annoying.I'm on a tight budget and your app is less stressful. My little one enjoys it. Thank you. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude01\ud83e\udd17 happy holidays, merry Christmas \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf81 and a happy New Year \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf86. I love this app! It has alot of up to date tv shows, Movies, as well as curtain news channels! Great channels for the kids and the whole family to enjoy. It has a little bit of something for everyone. You just have to take your time to look threw the channels. Once you familiarize yourself with using Pluto Tv it's AWSOME!. Absolutely Awesome and It's Free!! There's always something to watch, with an amazing amount of channels for all types of preferences. I had no problem activating on all tv's (fire tv 4k sticks) and the app works very well. There are live channels and on-demand. If your internet connection is sluggish, you may have trouble with the stream. For a better experience, you can set up your cell phone as a remote for Pluto TV. If You Are A Cord Cutter Like I Am... PLUTO TV IS A MUST HAVE!! \ud83d\udc4c. Absolutely amazing and would be worth spending money on. The fact that its free (ad supported) is really awesome. it works on any device flawlessly from what i have seen. Ps4, phone, tablet, computer. I dont own a smart tv but i would bet it will work on those. All my friends that i have told about it love it. Free tv and movies on demand its just wow. It was pointed out to me that paid tv still has commercials so technically this is very free.. Love ve this app. I've tried it back in the day but now it's different. Its awesome. I have a lot of apps;Hulu, Netflix exedra, but I pretty much find my self using Pluto most nights now. Has everything I need. News, horror movies, cult classics. Always something to find when I get tired of scrolling through the other apps. Yes there's ads,and they can be repetitive however no where near as bad as cable. Small price to pay for free tv imo.. This app is exactly as advertised. Free tv. All you have to do is finish a quick and simple registration process. Tons of classic and new tv shows and movies. The only downside is that the timing of the commercials. They sometimes kick in mid-sentence of a show but I'm not going to lower my rating just because of that. This app is great and they show a lot fewer commercials than regular tv. I love my Pluto TV! I have been using Pluto for more than 3 months now, enough time to make a honest and fair recommendation or tell the cut throat truth. Luckily I can recommend Pluto, first time for everything. I have no complaints, I enjoy the services all the way around. I read about the all the features and learned how to use them to effectively, they can stand behind all they offer with their services, when people follow the directions.. So far so good there's some neat stuff on here, remember it's free! But it works on my TV and on my phone and I don't think there's any more commercials than during National broadcasts of Sports and all the stuff on television. If you like James Bond, Baywatch, B horror flicks and such, this is your game! Is actually quite a few channels you can't be bored for long can always just switch to another Channel! Enjoy. This app is terrific. Brilliant! I have no other words to describe it. Usually, other apps that claim to be \"free\" require a credit card, but this app truly is free and doesn't require nothing. This is not a false-positive review as many may falsely claim to discredit the developer, this review I have written comes from my heart and usually I am one to complain about the littlest issue, but I give this app 5 stars. Enjoy your free TV America, trash your cable and get Pluto.. I love this app. I use it on my firestick. Everything is free (for real free not just some of it and then pay for additional). I use the app one my phone for the remote but can also use the firestick remote to change channels etc. I am actually surprised at how much content is available. There is also on demand options. There are ads. I don't think the ads are too much considering EVERYTHING is free but you might see the same one a few times in a row.. You've fixed issues and when I asked for newsmax to be added from your fb page, you listened and thanks so much for adding it to the lineup.. I love Pluto TV. I really think that it is a true blessing to have the ability to watch a free TV on your telephone and have wonderful movies available 24/7 without having to stand in line at the theater or see the same thing over and over again on cable. I'm going to buy a Roku just so I have Pluto on any TV I hook my Roku up to whether it's smart or not, I am!!!!", "neg_reviews": "would be a great App if it didn't freeze up often and there are way too many Ads. 2 minutes of the program then BAM...now 6 or 7 Ads! While l understand this App is Ad supported, why can't it be like REAL TV. 15 min of program then the commercials. Also tried to watch a movie at different times but a message pops up saying can't load movie at this time! My 1st review was in July 2019...Of course, no response from PLUTO TV to date as of 1/31/20 Still no response from Support as of Apr 26th 2020!. Put it on my Pixelbook. Worked fine on my Moto G7, but a pile of junk on my Pixelbook. When it starts up it's in full screen mode on a channel, can't get out of it and can't get to the channel menu. The only thing that works is manually advancing each station. No clue what I'm looking at. When I try to start a movie by accessing through the play store, the movie starts with a frozen screen and unable to start the movie. Don't download this on to a Pixelbook, it just doesn't work. Pretty terrible app for the pixelbook. Very disappointed.. I completely understand this a free service. However, the ad breaks are seriously obnoxious. There were literally 3 ad breaks within the first 20 minutes of a movie. A 1 hour 53 minute movie is extended to 2 hours and 30 minutes because of the ads. I ended up just renting the movie because the breaks ruined the whole viewing experience for me. Also, the ads are really repetitive so you can imagine how annoying that can get pretty quickly. I'm pretty sure Tubi isn't even this bad.. It would be a great app if you could control it. There's no way to check the schedule. You can only change one channel act a time. If you want to go from channel 50 to channel 300 that's 250 taps on the screen. You've got to be kidding. Amp has no operating instructions. It may be free but you'll spend hours just trying to find a show you want to watch. I have Android 8.1. Why doesn't the app work? New channel guide??? Not on my tablet! On Demand??? Not on my tab,et. There Isn't even a menu.. This was the best. Since I've had my Note 10+, about a month, this app was working great. Why did you have to ruin it? While there was room for improvement, the new channel listing stinks. In portrait, the picture shrinks to a ridiculously small thumbnail, if you want to browse through the list while watching something else. Show info is gone. Often,the list is mostly blank. But worst... the show's are constantly buffering. Thanks for breaking what really didn't need fixing.. I can't turn it off without going into Android settings and Force-Stopping the app! There doesn't appear to be an Exit function in the interface. When i try to leave, the sound stays on! I sent a service request to Pluto, but they didn't get back to me for several days. I finally got an email today, in which they said nothing about the problem I'd reported, and further said they'd closed the ticket. Huh? What kind of \"service\" is that?. There are too many commercials on this app you spend more time watching commercials than you do the actual tv. There are 3 times more commercials on this app than on regular cable TV. I would give it a higher rating if there were less commercials. But you spend more time watching them than what's on the channel. I can't tell you what good shows is on this app because it's all commercials and no tv. As soon as you open the app it automatically starts playing a random television program that you cannot stop or pause. In fact, the app has no stop or pause button anywhere, and no way to configure the app - there are no app settings. Two stars because the app delivers what it promises: free ad-supported TV and movies. But no more than two stars because the developers play content automatically and don't allow users to have any control over the app. Uninstalled.. I used to like Pluto, but tecent updates put Live TV as the focus. Previously, when you chose On Demand.....it wouldn't automayically change to Live TV at the \"end\" of what you watched. That wouldn't be so bad, if you didn't have to struggle to return to On Demand again. Since most of what I am interested in can be found on other sites, I have chosen to delete this app.. System crashes everytime when trying to sign into my account. I understand completely you need to make money for us to have free movies and tv, but every 10 to 12 minutes you must watch 4 minutes of commercials. That is ridiculous. Can not fast forward to the last spot of a previous movie without be forced to watch all the commercial brakes to that point. This is crazy. It takes almost 3 hours to watch a 2 hour and 18 minute movie. Very unhappy right now.. I love the app!!! So many good shows on whenever I watch tv...but....For the love of all things great, PLEASE!!! PLEASE!!! PLEASE!!! stop playing the same ads over and over and over again. Sometimes the same ad back to back, your literally going to drive me insane when watching TV. That's suppose to be my relax time. But I'm going insane watching the same ad again and again and again!!!!. They really need to update the content. There are sooo many more seasons of shows out there and Pluto only plays a few. Also, please downsize on the amount of ads, which seem to pop up every two minutes. It gets annoying. For some reason, it's not allowing me to watch picture-in-picture which is my preferred method on my android.. It's free, but.... The video continuity is terrible, shows back up and fast forward a few minutes all the time, show audio is playing during commercials, then once it's playing in sync, it stops playing and displays problems playing. Nice idea by far, but oh my gosh is it glitchy. I haven't been able to watch anything all the way through without missing half the program and having to close and reopen the app. Then the issues start over again. 5/23/2021... Deleted the app from all my devices.. Biggest problems that ruin the whole experience is A) A complete lack of a search tool. Instead, you have to look for the show or movie you want MANUALLY. Just keep scrolling and hope you find it. B) There are an an absurd amount of ads. I watched just one episode of Primeval, which is fifty-five minutes to an hour long, and I got five thirty-second unskippable ads EVERY FIVE MINUTES. Tone down the ads. They're pulling a YouTube and making the vanilla version worse to make you pay for Premium.. Biggest problems that ruin the whole experience is A) A complete lack of a search tool.

They're pulling a YouTube and making the vanilla version worse to make you pay for Premium.. My review is about the app specifically, not the Pluto TV service, which I enjoy. This app is deficient in a couple of ways: It presents notifications, which can't be turned off in its settings (which are minimal). The lack of any meaningful setting controls also means there's no way to govern what notifications it shows. Also, it only plays sound while it's on screen and the phone is unlocked. This makes sense for a video-only app, but Pluto has some nice music channels I'd like to listen to while doing other things on the phone or while out walking.. So many commercials! I watched 75% of an on demand movie on my tv. I had to stop and switch to my tablet. It doesn't let you skip ahead to that spot but has to show you every single commercial they've dropped into the movie to get to that point. It was over 10 minutes of commercials to get back to that point! I understand showing one commercial break, but this was unbelievably excessive. Forget it! I'll just wait until I can get back to my TV which is still sitting there on pause (thankfully).. I really want to love this app but it's getting repetitive. Why do you advertise certain shows for channels but never play them?. Its the same shows on repeat and then it's not even updated. Once a season plays, shouldn't you move to the next. The same things have been playing for over a year since I got this app. The movies change but the TV shows don't.. It didn't work at all. 2.3.22:. Theirs a lot of repeat when at gose to commercials. And at the End of the shows (10-15 minutes) it repeats again. (2-17-22) Now, the app deletes My Favorites and I have to input them again and again. Before I post this review the app deletes My Favorites 4 time's. It looks like I'm having to go to my sister's app Paramount Plus to watch what I do watch on the app. If this does not get fixed, I'm sorry to say bye to my best app that I watched all the time,. Does not work with Chromecast! Has not worked right since install! You have service issues that need to be fixed with Chromecast to get it to load properly and play the media correctly! Takes too long to load or won't load at all and keeps disconnecting! You need to fix the CBSN feed. Keeps cutting out every 15 seconds! This is an ongoing problem! All the other channels work! I'm missing key pieces of info when cbsn keeps cutting out! You have not fixed the obvious problems! Pluto won't work!!", "pos": "Negative reviews: Some of the channels I watch are so scrambled.

When you throw the dice it dont matter in what order they come out should give us the result. For example a get a lot of straight numbers but in this order \"1 3 2\" or \"5 4 6\" it would be a matter of the game to just line them up.. I love this game. My request to developer is please improve UI as scrolling functionality in friend list is very poor, and when we invite someone for team up match at that page we don't know whether someone else is inviting us or not. Sometime both person keep inviting each other without knowing they are being invited or not. And let the user copy text from chat window because sometime we need to translate it.. My most favourite game but my facebook account disabled when i am reached level 32 i made again facebok account again disabled \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude1e I think game developer should give opportunity to connect with email account in game if it is possible. My experience in parchisi STAR has been simply amazing. I am in love with a polish girl and i taught her to play parchis with this game. Since then, we have played hundreds of times as a team. It has brought us together. We have laughed, we have cried, we have jumped and celebrated. The moments this game gave me with my girl are worth the world. We may have never kissed for the first time were it not because of this game. I will always be in debt with you. PD. Using gems to roll is a bit dirty.. It's a lot of luck, I really enjoy how a game can turn around, you never know who is going to win or lose, changing the dice roll with gems is fun but using those doesn't assure victory, you're faced with decisions which piece to move with the dice roll you're given. You can turn off your screen if interrupted walk away turn it back on and the AI will play for you. even if you lose the match, any pieces sent home will still count for goals! I just wish I could be Green or Blue on 2 player.. Overall, a great app. The game is fun, free, and you get to play against people from all over the world. I like the different avatars and tokens. My only suggestion would be to make it easier for blockades to be broken. The current rule of using (statistically improbable) doubles to break blockades means they can drag on for way too long which is annoying and frustrating for everyone. I would suggest that instead blockades be broken when a 6 (or another #) are rolled to improve gameplay.. This game is addictive and fun ( depending upon your opponent) I like when you become busy(for whatever reason..)the game plays on auto and you don't lose your connection or your game. Different types of pegs are hard to get, but that's miner compare to the gems you have to pay if you lose a tournament.. Great game. Easy to learn. 5 different ways to play, offline is 1 of the options! You don't have to watch ads unless you want extra coins. You get coins when you play tho so you really don't have to watch them. I got pretty damned good and earned my coins winning lol, thank you too creators of this and to the potential players, I'LL SEE YA OUT THERE. Sorry I had to edit my review to add, I've never spent money on the game and still win alot. The reviews complaining they can't win without payi. Addicting and fun game. :) Only thing I wish we would be able to translate players language to your own, so you can talk/communicate better. Or have the option to play in one language at times. Though it can make the game more fun and challenging with multiple languages!. At least this game works very well for me. The connection on team modes and communication is almost always good (although it'd be nice to maintain the same cell numbers on team mode. That hasn't happened to me yet but I've heard it that happens). Besides that, until now I haven't suffered any problem with the app. It is fun, easy and somewhat addictive if you want to earn lot of money and get lots of chests. Very recommended, especially if you wanna play with some friends near or far from you ;). Even after reinstalling many times....I am not able to watch ads and take my rewards....due to this I am not able to achieve help ration.... please fix your bugs. I love Gameberry so much now. I learn Parchisi here and I have a lot of fun since then. You integrated it marvellously - play, rewards, rank and so many other things to do. One suggestion - Keep improving the UI design. Thanks to the Gameberry Team.. I love this game. But can you please make a \"Quick\" option to the game like ludo star? Please make it. Otherwise we need to wait for special event to play quick. I love the option playing \"Quick\". Please make the game more enjoyable.. Love it! I have so much fun during quarentine playing the game I loved when I was a child. I don't agree with all the negative comments, you either dont know how to play or you are unlucky, that's it! I don't pay to play, I have lost and won many times and I am pretty sure it's because my strategy or luck with the dices. Just have fun people, this game is really good. Besides, I can play with my family that lives far away. I totally recommend it!. Pretty fun. Wish people couldnt block you at times, but its a 50/50 chance of it helping at all. Pretty solid game, the chests take a bit too long and its hard to unlock cosmetics without gems, but its free. If you dont care about the cosmetic aspect, its a great game. If you ever played clash royale, the season pass and chests are similiar to this.. it's great easy to play and fast too, there is always someone to play with but i wish i had a cute dice. Thanks for creating this game! I'm meeting lots of friends and I'm happy you offer so much money for watching a brief ad. I'm, also, happy that the ads aren't Always played in full. I'm addicted! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0d. It's so fun to play with friends fun trying to collect money. This is a very good game.

Don't dare spend a dime on this game! Like majority of the reviewers here say, the roll algorithm is completely rigged. I've been playing parchesi/ludo since I was a young girl and the game itself requires some skill and naturally luck. However, THIS game will predetermine who will get 1st place.You'll get terrible rolls, setting you up to be killed and sent home. This game is not based on luck and strategy. It's based on developer greed.. Rigged game Without a doubt, you'll notice yourself. I had a nonjudgmental position about the scores. The probability of some dice combinations isn't as it's supposed to be; it isn't random. Sometimes you need a particular number and even though the chances might be good for you, you'll still wait 5-6 turns and the other player might win. Try to play without gems and you'll realize how hard it actually is to beat this game, not your opponent but the game itself.. Many times the game is parcial towards a player. At a specific time of a day the dices thrown at you are always low while the the other player gets dobles and high numbers. So even if you play the best game without mistakes you will lose. I can only win at night and early mornings. Not mornings or afternoons. Play this game for fun only and because you like the game. It is unfair many times with the dices. You can predict on many games what dice # is going to be. Fair???. Then you play it.. Whenever I lose a game or games in a stupid way, I come here to edit my review, and precisely describe my feelings... But reviews haven't changed anything, I suppose. The more I play this game the more I realise that your everybody-is-happy algorithm is inevitable. If you're reading this, you are going to play in a scenario, you gonna win when the game allows you to, you gonna lose when the game wants you to, there's nothing you can do about this. * (my win rate is 56%) Update: It's been a year (or maybe more), and now that I have lost a lot of games in the same way (conspiracy), I wish I could describe my feelings... But it's F-ugly to play this game. The only thing I recommend is that you don't want to play this game. Please, don't copy past that reply of yours.. I actually love this game! But it's not fear! Cannot believe it! It frustrates me because the game decides who's going to win no matter how good your strategy is. It's not the first time it happens to me, I just played a game and guess what? Both of my pieces where on last tab just missing a 1 to win. I needed a double 1 and I got the double 1 in the dices but nothing happened!!! Instead of winning, the game didn't move the pieces and I GOT THE DOUBLE ONE but the game didn't want me to win!. The game could be fun . . .but with the ability to \"pay to win\" by rerolling dice with gems for desirable outcomes it isn't fun at all for the \"free to play\" player. I have seen some people that will hold a barricade on purpose near your entrance when you're going to get a token all the way home and they will reroll all of their doubles so they never need to open and you inevitably get eaten and sent back to base. That isn't fair and there should be separate game modes for f2p and p2w.. Initially I rated it the highest but I could noticed that as you buy coins or gems it's like it will let you lose like so many times in arrow, it's like pre-arranged and it is totally u fair, all they care is about yo spending more and more as you lose an lose, you can tell. It is not posible to lose so many straight games. If I could I would only rate it half a star because of this. Confirmed all the high bets I lose them and let me win the tiny ones. TOTALLY PREDETERMINED. I so much hate it.. The game chooses experienced players to give them benefits of getting best rolls. It's a very cheati game. The rolls are not random, everyone gets exactly what they need to win. Feels like you don't even have to try. Definitely if you're higher level and have played the game for a long while. The game helps you to win the matches to keep the frequent players happy. Okay... its a pretty and stressful game, the only fact that I'm trying to understand is why I'm looking 2 ads and instead of 1. In my opinion it's an abuse to the \"community\" take advantage of how long an ad lasts, it isn't our problem and we shouldn't see any more ads just because some don't last 30 seconds. You're literally the only game that take advantage of this, it's pathetic in every way.. I am not able to use gems even I have 40000. When I click on required time even so quickly but not able to get the benefits. It happened almost 7/10 in a single game. And screen even gone black too..worst game ever from blueberry . Ludo star 1,2 was fine but this is not in pakistan.. As other reviews have said, the game is slanted toward certain players (who all seem to know each other...) or bots or whatever is going on. The constant pop-ups asking for money are supremely annoying and there's no way to get off the \"chest\" screen without either watching the add or completely closing the app and reopening it. There is also no way to reset your statistics, which stinks since the games are so badly rigged. A good idea poorly executed.. Whoever made this game are animals, damn you and your game. I think it's very unfair that I'm playing and I make a good strategy and suddenly the game lost wifi connection and returned the move that I just did and plays automatically moving a token that I didn't move at any time and make me lose. I thought it was normal, but it has happened to me several times and I know it's not my Internet is the game that cheats, that's stressful and make me want to uninstall the app, so please fix that.. First of all I would like to mention that even 2 stars are so much for the game, the emojies of donkey and other things are not good, and also the chat isn't good I started to avoid playing just because of that, there is a country( I don't want to mention the name) they are there just to make people angry.. at least give us the chance to choose a country with whom we can play.. 1. Crashes all the time. It used to happen while navigating the menus, now in the middle of a game too. 2. The fact that players can cheat as long as they pay money to change the roll makes the games rigged. 3. I've played parchisi since childhood and never seen so many consecutive doubles in real life rolls. There's definitely something odd with the randomizer.. I wish they would stop responding with \"This game is about strategy and luck\" No it's not, I lose more than I win. Do you know what happened the one time I was going to win? The opponent/cpu left the game. And the fact that you can predict that you going to get 2 and 1 on your dice while your opponent gets the 6 and 5 or a double is BS. Please,this game is so Rigged.. The game is fun to an extent. I think it's stupid if you roll 3 times doubles you get penalized and get sent home but when ppl block the whole freaking time it's not penalized??!! That should get penalized after the 3rd round still blocking. When you play with 6 ppl your time to think to move is cut in half which is stupid. Also there's time in waiting to get 1 to win and 10 rounds will go and I still never get a 1??!!! Yeah right this game is rigged. Better play it physically than play it here.. This game is a fraud. NEVER spend a dollar purchasing gems, the game will make you lose all the time, so you spend all the gems and have to buy more. The magic daily pick is not working at all, I watch the videos and try to collect everything the app gave me. But every time I pick it a card on magic pick it gave me an error. I think this is on purpose to make me buy.. It really is rigged! I can't even hold a block and the opponent holds theirs for more than 5 rounds! Why not make it so that after 3 turns you HAVE to remove your block! And it's true. At the beginning you allready know who is going to win! You use your gems and still!!! So many times I need a 1 to win and the opponent gets double double and suddenly bam!

They have tons of different games, including a bunch of minigames, all of which are FREE, no ads required (though you can watch for bonuses). This game is NOT pay to play, and is NOT impossible to play as a beginner. While getting better guns help, this game mostly relies on skill, making it a fair playing field. Speaking of which, the maps and graphics are all fantastic, and the controls are smooth. Please try it!!!. Its a decent game but gets repetitive, toxic, and other issues but has potential.. This is a very interesting game. Some of my views is that I think that the mainland Battle Royale should extend more, so to have more time + space to roam about. Also, try reducing the amount of space used for the game as it takes up a lot of it. Lastly, buying expensive weapons is too much as it cost lots of coins. I advice to reduce the cost so to be fair. Thank you n keep up the good work!. I love this game, quite a lot actually. I've been a fan for over 6 years, and everything I see today is alright... except the new matchmaking. Queuing up for a gamemode is not fun, let alone a specific map. Bring back the old matchmaking and I'll rate 5 stars. The game is pay to win yes, but if you work hard enough you wont have to pay at all. Edit: They fixed matchmaking. I think it's a really, really great game... except for he fact that it's a PAY TO WIN game. You honestly can't win unless you have the best weapons. Also, I had to delete this game 5 yrs ago, now that I downloaded it again, a lot has changed. I dont even get to play island resort and many other maps that I loved... I feal like they should bring back everything and change it back to the way it was. This has to be one of the best pixel shooters out there, I am addicted to this game and I started playing this in 2015. I love the features you guys have added, but there is one thing I would truely love, there should be a community skin shop. Where you go to that shop and you can buy user created skins and even share your own! That would be a really great feature. Also maybe a boots editor where we can make our own boots! I hope this game turns #1 in the world! Keep up the great work Cubic Games. This game is amazing. I love the fact that you can play offline. And there's only a few ads so it makes the game even more amazing. and the fact that if you level up you can get more op guns to kill the ppl who spend like 3000 bucks on this game. i havent spent a dollar on this game and i can beat people. so for all those haters, just keep trying! yeah its a really cool game but so many people waste money on this game, but if you level up you can clap them. Difficult but rewarding. As a free to play person it was hard starting from level 1 to 65 again, however I managed to reach level 65 within a couple of months and I now have just as many weapons if not more than my old account. As for the gameplay, it is still the same as I remember back in 2014. There are still spammers and they are still annoying but, you have to get used to it until the developers stop them but it looks like they actually support spammers. Other than that very, very fun.. I absolutely love this game. I used to play it 3 years ago i don't know why I stopped playing. I have a suggestion for the game. It is can you guys or developers make it so its easier to get gems \ud83d\udc8e and coins? I would really like that. Also on the parkour mini game it scammed me out of 7 gems! Can you please fix that. Please make the shooting better and also add more features to the skin maker editor please? Thanks for making the game for what it is now.. Phenomenal. Great graphics and it's so easy to play. The whole concept is great. But does take a lot of coins to get good weapons. So prices could be lower but overall it is one of my favourite games. One small problem though. In clan wars when my clan gets 3rd place or even second as soon as the war is over we are ranked sixth. I know this because I checked the valor points right before it ended and we were 3rd place but when the results came we were six. Edit: Sorry, it says the link expired. Well, I give a 5 star because the gameplay is pretty good. I mean, I can move around perfectly fine and the controls are easy to access, I dont have to reach my thumb halfway across the screen to shoot, thats cool. And yes, some of the opponets are either overpowered and probably better than someone who is new. You see, going againt someone better is frustrating, I will agree with that. It is simple and has good graphics. There are a few problems but is a good game. GJ Pixel Game 3D.. This game is amazing! I've almost been playing for six years now! It's always been up to date with fresh updates and new exciting content! Except for one thing... Lately everyone has been having problems with the servers.. you have no idea how frustrating it is to be on a kill streak, or be doing very good then you get kicked from the server. No one is safe from this bug, it's been happening to literally everyone, I can't stay in the same server for 3 minutes without it wanting to vanish me.. I love the old versions when you upgrade your weapons it changes its appearance same goes for Armour, and this game is kinda pay to win now but the game play is great and I haven't spent a dime! EDIT: The more I play the more I like it but for some reason I keep getting kicked from the game because it keeps saying it stopped working, and I also had a really good account and I've lost it soemhow.. This game was a part of my childhood back in 2013. I love how the game is compared to how it was years ago. There's many modes including ones that don't even involve shooting. Also frequent updates and active developers. I even just emailed them recently about a bug with my gems being taken away and got replies, fixes, and compensation within the next 2 days. It's so fun, I love this game the multiplayer is a really good l, the single player is a bit hazy, and some of the mini games are really fun. But one problem is the Walking Fortresses(2 At-Ats), as much that it is my favorite stage, I wish you could jump of and land on an At-st, and and what would be great is making a team and capture the flag stage based off the attack on planet Hoth. So many ideas but one is to do more events then seasonal ones. This is a really fun game! Recently, it's had a lot of new updates and things, but they are pretty nice and the game overall is very fun. You can choose a character, items, and a name. items, can even customize the character. Then, you go to play against different people (usually on a team, but you can also play solo.) and battle! Sometimes this game can be frustrating, but only for little things like adds or players targeting you.. I've been playing for up to 4-5 years now, I'm having a whole lot of fun with it, sometimes rounds aren't fair because how much money people spend on this game, I remember the good old days (2013-2016 era.) It was much easier and more skill based, It didn't require money to win games, but also the old spammers with the ghost lantern were really annoying, I remember old weapons like the pig hammer, desert fighter, and the others, but they were removed from the game, but yet i still enjoy it. <3.

Its a very good game but there is one thing i would like in the game. I think that they should add custom weapons. For example, making your own weapon wrap and making a gun that has certain limits on what you can do with it like if you choose it to shoot rockets it can only reload at a slow speed, or if its gonna be 30 damage then it can be rapid fire. Thank you for reading this and i hope you have a nice time. Since release I have adored and loved this masterpiece, on every single device I own I have had this game, I don't think that I could do it justice in text but I will try. 1) The amount of content in this game is astounding, like wow! 2) Not once in my time playing have I encountered a game braking bug, 3) The player base is so friendly. But I do have some issues, the game does require you to grind for some weapons, but they are achievable, some weapons are a bit to OP. Overall, a great game!", "neg_reviews": "This game used to be good, but now it's literally just pay-to-win. Every game I join, everyone has better guns than me, which makes the game unplayable when the has guns literally out of your league. Every other gun either cost at least 300 coins or at least 100 gems. The only way to get that much is with real money, and I'm not doing that. And every match I join, everyone is a way more experienced player then I am. The devs are money greedy and don't care about your experience.. This game used to be awesome, and now its just really complicated. before, you could understand everything, but now the game is just really complicated with these weapon attachments and coupons that you get from trading gun sets. The game also wont work properly if you dont have infinite storage and a top notch device. it takes up so much space, and whenever i try to log on, it just kicks me out in like 10 seconds, before i can even do anything.. The game has been ruined. Only pay to win, you get matched with people 10 levels higher, crashes every 13 minutes and if you sit and watch ads 24/7 you might get a good gun. Not to mention the new auto shoot. This game doesn't require skill anymore, it requires you to have the most money and the best gun. I'm sorry to admit this, but it was much better before. You ruined it all. Uninstalled.. Great game and cool graphics. Why 2 stars though? Glitches, bugs, getting kicked out of the game or not even being able to play. Not to mention the p2w. If you dont spend atleast 100 dollars on this game then dont even bother. Everything costs so much that it'll take maybe years to even catch up to the money spenders. If you are looking for a good shooter game then go somewhere else. If you want to try it out then be my guest. But i dont recommend this.. I used to play a year ago and i can't get my old account back that i spent real money on. It's really frustrating when you can't get your account back with money spent on it and you have to restart all of your progress. Also i had finished all of the campaigns or story mode or whatever you call them on that account. Pixel gun company if your reading this rating please fix the data transferring so we can get are saved data.. Played this for 10 years, the current result is sad. It was fun 10 years ago, where you could play the game and work and have fun to get new weapons, now it's just \"Gimme $20 for this instant one shot gun with unlimited ammo\" The downfall of this game was very sad for me. Please bring back the old game, where you didn't have to use money to have fun.. This game, while extremely fun in the early stages, quickly becomes a money fueled grind to obtain and upgrade equipment to a point where you can damage your opponents. The grind becomes very apparent once you start being paired with players of equal level who have maxed equips. Unless you have money to sink into better weapons and armor, I wouldn't recommend this game. Without the grind, this game is a masterpiece, and will always have a place in my heart.. The \"old days\" of pixel gun used to be better; (1)it takes a while for everyone to die, (2) the weapons, items, etc. are available to everybody, and (3) the game is just purely on skill, regardless wether your enemy has a better gun. Almost every single game I enter, there is at least one enemy that can literally one shot me, even though my armor is already at max level, based on my current level. Some weapons are only available to Pay to win players, which are the most powerful weapons.. Ok, this game is a bust. I have played since 2014, and it was beautiful! Nothing was overpriced, ads didn't exist, everyone was curious to see what worked with what... but now you can get softlocked before you get to level 3. And before that happened, back in 2020 (when I could play), guns were hella overpriced, and everyone had just broken items at level 40 while the new players were confused and being abused by the veterans. This game changed. I want the old one back. Also fix softlock thx.. It's a good game, but then after some time we started to have pay to win. When I go in battles it instead throws and ad at me. And then it restarts the game, depleting my trophies, 50 by 50. It may sound like \"no big deal\", but it is, same applies when I go in a battle the game immediately crashes. And then it takes away trophies. I don't think this isn't a big about the game crashing then restarting, but it may be a problem of how much people are in a certain server at once. THERE IS MORE BUGS!. Uh, to be honest, it is a good game but first, alot of ads, second, sometimes when you make a squad, the player doesn't get the invite cuz they are stuck in a update, third, THE FRICKEN PRICES ARE IMOSSIBLE TO GET LIKE IF YOU DO THIS IN REAL LIFE NOBODY WILL EVEN BUY IT BUT RICH PEOPLE OR PROS! ITS LITERLY STUPID! Does the creator even read this anymore? And lastly, the chests JUST GIVE YOU DAMN PARTS EVERYTIME!!! Sorry game but you really need to work on this, its been a problem for a year so,\ud83d\ude2b. had this game for 7 years, it is awesome. Well, it used to be. Now this game is filled with players who spam heavy section weapons and OP gadgets. You need to pay a large amount of money to get good guns now. The game isn't the same anymore. It used to be a simplistic, fun, blocky shooter but now, its only a fraction of what it was in its glory days.. Game got updated and some features are still super terrible, like the fact that I took time maxing out my weapons, and now they dont do anything, and it costs about 500 coins for 1 upgrade, just cause I leveled up once. I am ok with the idea of having to upgrade the weapons, but when we level up, give us more coins/gems, or make upgrading a lot cheaper. It became a pay to win game easily.. This game is fun in the start. Everytime you level up you get undercompinsated and can't really buy weapons, no matter how much you save. Also the randomized lobbies use a trick that takes advantage of your brain. The trick they use makes it so everytime you get something good without spending money, it pits you against harder players. Thus making it so you feel a need to spend money because no matter how much you grind, if you don't spend money then the opponents will still be better than you.. This was total carp I have been playing this game for years and I had to uninstall it for a while but i had everything saved in Google play, when I finally got the game back I was so excited to finally get all my stuff back because i was level 27 and i had really powerful guns and pets but all my coins, gems, guns, armor, and pets gone my level was back to 1 and I was waiting for the message to come up and say I can load my stuff back but nothing ever happened. All those years wasted.. Update to my review a year later: Still a lot of P2W, with some things not even possible to obtain even if you grind all day. I love the game and I really hope that one day the devs reform the system, make it less predatory and more focused on retaining long-term players. But as it stands the game is only something you should play if you have a lot of time on your hands - and above all dont even mother trying to spend real money here - previously bought things eventually become useless.. I remember playing this when it was a good game. Now they introduced so many elements and so many microtransactions and it's now a game that only exists to earn profit. All of the elements of the game are designed to trick young people into spending money. An example of this is no warning message when you're about to click another tile on that daily reward thing. That you spend your diamonds and it encourages desperate children to purchase more.. Thank you Pixel Gun for making a much better update. I'm pretty glad we have a gallery to help us know which weapons we have. You also updated the Battle Royale mode, but most of the weapons in that mode kill players TOO easily. Take the \"Huge Boy\" for example. It almost one shots full armored players, and that weapon isn't the only weapon that is too op. Either increase the amount of health or change the weapon damage of the guns in Battle Royale.. Used to be fun. This game is so PAY TO WIN. I can't spend any of MY money on a game, and now everyone's killing me because we're all level 30 but they all have crazy mythics and super weapons. I would recommend to the owners to set people in matches based on there weapon level and type (Rare, Commom, etc.) Put all of the rich kids in the same game, and all of the people who don't spend money in a game together! I don't want to play anymore. Everything else is good.. Game was really good and fun until cubic games turned it pay to win.\ud83d\ude2a Also I have like 3 different accounts that I can't get back, most of them being level 30. (When 30 was max) I made some purchases on one of them. Also why does it cost so much coins to upgrade just one level of a weapon like c'mon man, 380 coins to upgrade my heart of volcano to level 31?!

Still its balanced for all types of players to some extent..U can also play with your facebook friends in your team to strengthen up. Love this game. Over 6k matches played and no forced ads or need to spend money. I loved it so much I was happy to pay \u00a33.99 when there was an offer on but it was not needed to enjoy the full game. Please add the ability to tap on the keeper to bring him out rather than it being AI controlled. Please add golden goal for cup games rather than penalties. Please add custom games for matches with friends. Great game, keep up the good work.. This is the best football mobile game ever, you don't have to pay to be perfect, but you have to practice a lot, like really a lot but hard work pays off, still some adjustments has to be made and rewards for normal user has to be better but we get the concept and if the normal rewards are satisfying no one will pay, the ads are perfect and the Technical support team responds fast and very helpful. At the end this app really deserves respect. Please add the feature of controlling the goalkeeper.. Never ever played any game so long, just out of words. Every football player, fan or just if you are in love in football game, try it! Fantastic peace of gameplay art, with easy playing mechanism, always in line with same skill opponents and you can play it any time you want. No money needed to keep your satisfaction at top level, all the time. 50 stars if possible :). Loved playing it. I have been playing for a week and still I've not gotten bored of it. If made this game a bit better taking everyone's suggestions, I'm 10000% sure that Score! Match will get to the top of the table in football genre.. Hey hey, to all of you who made this great game for us football/soccer fanatics. Job really well done.\ud83d\ude42 One thing I would like. That you as player can choose where the goalkeeper goes \"like in..taking penalties \" when someone takes a shot.. Makes it more real..because it's up to you where you wanna go. Thanks for a great game.\ud83d\udc4c. This is the best android football game I have played so far and many of my friends have started playing because of me. But still there are a few recommendations which will make it even more entertaining game. 1) There should be an in-game voice chat option so that players can have a bit of chat while playing. 2) There should be a friend request option so that anyone can make In-game friends and can play with them afterwards. 3) No of assists, Goal forced with header should be included in profile. This is one of those games that is so simple yet so much fun. One of the best games you can get on a phone. It must be well over a year since I have installed this game. That is saying something. As most know it is hard to keep apps when needing space. Most games stay installed for only a couple of days. I like this game more now then when I first started playing!. This is great really, very creative. I don't like the 2nd goal of death, and always a penalty shootout if draw. The better option would be to have a golden goal after 2 min draw. I'm missing some sort of league table. As for the gameplay, penalties are very good simulated. I think it would be good to have an option to just continue the run, maybe to be able to give player a direction. Also, give us much more tactical stuff out of the box pls. I think you have somerhing great here.. Best football game, BY FAR. At times you might think that this is very luck-based, but believe me, formerly one of you, it is not. You just need to check your team and make few adjustments. First of all, this is such a unique and genius concept and that too, they absolutely pushed it to its upper limit. Commentary, good relaxing theme music, medium-paced gameplay, easy to play (you can play it with one hand), etc.. This is just a full package. Good football IQ is all you need as a prerequisite.. The ads experience here is perfect. Not like the many other games that show u ads all the time. Impressed me so much that I spent money. That's the way to make good games. Gameplay is good. I think the developer can really take it further and make the gameplay even more detailed and competitive. This can really be something that people play for a long time.. Fix Defensive issues of miss timing and lose tackles improve GK+++ inbetween ads must be lower data! Quick 1 on 1 Penalty match modes for too short time plays! Goal line clearences on upgraded players, time based matches than no of goals! Draw all normal matches without shootout and only on events! Local game with friends! Introduce almost legends like players without lisence, with almost similar names and skills! Real world like events but without lisence, with almost similar names and rules. Great Game. If you have played and liked Score Hero you will love this one. Its not an offline game because you need to connect with your opponent. Really fast as well and entertaining. Really addictive!. I must admit that I do love this game, \"Score Match\" in the deep bottom of my heart. But, if you, gentlemen make further progress on this game, it would become more better than now. For example, in my heart while I am playing this game, I would love to communicate with my opponents. Although you, guys have stickers communication tap, we would very much enjoy the game if we could talk each other through speaker. I have lots of words about this game.. this game is amazing everything IS good I just have a suggestion you should add a slot for number of assists each player has next to number of goals amazing game Thanks you guys make it too hard to win. This game keeps you pushing your limit. It engages you to test your patience. You're never sure of winning. You can lose to a weaker opponent likewise you can defeat a very strong opponent. The key is you cannot make a false move. Play right, you can win straightaway. This is the game that's been on my phone for the longest time. Love this game \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f. I have played the score hero...it was not that good but fine in a different way of a football game...now I got this one..is really so good that I have never played before...this is what a mobile football game should be...(fifa mobile,pes etc..)some other football game be like huge in size but still not that cool and not that bad too...but this one ...I really appreciate that...I'm enjoying this game a lot.... a nice game giving total footballing experience... more than enough realistic... overall a great experience... sometimes asking to pass when you don't want to and sometimes player running with the ball when needed to pass... that's all what can improve. otherwise a cool one.... Great app. One of the best games I ever played. I wish if there is time after the first minute (15 seconds) that we can do change to team squad or players. Thanks. My favorite mobile game, its so simple and fun! Any football fan would love this game. I wish you could have the ability to change your players' numbers though. With all the new special players added, they all have high numbers on their kit that are similar to each other and its confusing to know who is who since some players look alike. I pass to the wrong player sometimes because of that issue. But other than that, great game and i recommend anyone to try it \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "neg_reviews": "Whenever you pass ur ball the opponents takes it and whenever the opponents pass the ball we are unable to take it. Players are not in control of us. Every time I click the player it is not moving , it is just standing like a statue. Pathetic game I have ever played in my life. If there would be a option for giving zero star than I would have chosen that.. This game is crazy. This gaming app intentionally fails to score and point out fake fouls. I have been playing this for last 3 years. But, you have not fixed this bug till today. Whenever, matchmaking server connection fails, I choose the option \"Support\". This \"Support\" button doesn't work properly. I think developers of the game 'Score! Match - PvP Soccer' doesn't care of its players' issues. Happy to uninstall the app.. -Always calls a foul when I try to tackle my opponent, but when they do something worse to me no foul. -In a shootout, my keeper went the right way and it just goes in off his foot. But when my opponents goes the right way, never goes in off their foot. Also this game is so scripted. The same outcomes come from the same scenarios. This game is just too horrible for me to like. Lastly, my striker turned around instead of shooting when on goal... Like why?? This game is a piece of biased garbage.. I enjoy the game but I'm becoming increasingly frustrated I can't seem to progress past level 8, I have been relegated and promoted about 17 times. I don't understand what is going on with the game play, I've spent money to buy platinum boxes to improve my team and nothing works. Very very disappointed!!!!!! You have no respect at all for people who spend money on this game!!!! There are no comparison between players skill levels!!!!. I gave it 5 star before but I am giving it 1 star now because this game has no common sense. I am facing this problems- 1. Horrible Match making. 2. Low level players can easily run past my high level players. 3. When I'm in a long wining streak my game automatically crashes and restart. I applied many tricks and it didn't work. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled but the problem is same. If you solve this problems then I will give it 5 stars. Edit- FTG doesn't care about their players \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21. Probably a really good game in there somewhere but in it's current form it's unplayable but the developers seem to have no interest in changing things. If I go on a winning run, it's followed by a losing one and vice versa. Both feel terribly scripted at times, win or lose. Most players also just lump ball into the box to tall (overpowered) players and you can't stop goals. So boring. Everyone playing hoofball and corners as good as a penalty - that's not right.. Playing this more than a year, the gameplay is attractive, but you only can win if algorithm allows you! Eventually you can win against stronger opponent, and sometimes lower opponent plays like a pro! Looks like this is system defined, and your progress is relatively slow unless you spend money or invest lots of time to play. With good gameplay experience you can also get frustrated by these things.. The sh!tiest game I ever played due to:- 1) horrible matchmaking 2)pay to win game 3)biasing towards opponents whenever we're winning (eg: unnatural kinds of saves, not calling fouls etc...) 4)setting of the game so that you'll spend extra time playing the game to get some rating points 5)Terrible AI of players (eg: 1 player keeping the ball until he gets tackled, unresponsive players, players staying out of way so that opponents score etc...) In all don't play this game; it's not worth it.. I've played this game for several years now and feel that I'm in a good position to review properly. This game has the potential to be excellent, different competition modes available, options to use players from Facebook friends and the chance to build and develop your team. However, this game is extremely scripted and geared to reward players who spend an inordinate amount of money to progress. This takes away immensely from the other positive features and invalidates the potential good points. I love this game and play it a lot (level 10) but it's become to frustrating with the graphics issue. Every other game, I'd find myself starting with the players of both teams all blacked up (faces and attire) and I can't differentiate between who plays for me and who's against. This issue affects random games and I can't see any pattern to it.. This game is quite simply awful. The mechanics will screw you over constantly. You will have the ball in the clear and your player will then decide to turn around just for the sake of it. You will notice your players will constantly lose the ball while the opponent's will be scoring from miles out lol. The game is a complete fix. If your planning on playing for the 1st few levels then deleting that it's good for you, anything longer and you will feel screwed over 95% of the time. Avoid!. Legitimate tackles given as fouls, teams that put the ball out of play given throw ins and, there seems to be a need to give at least one penalty a game. They say that games aren't predetermined but they are. Keepers pull off unrealistic saves, passes not available, constantly give away fouls or caught offside, directional arrows mean nothing. A real shame but, it seems that all they're interested in is money. This used to be the best game ever. With the updates came a lot of issues. First was logging in to the game, then that was sorted. Now the game lags and constantly complains about connection problems and my internet is 100%, keeps pausing and when it resumes sometimes you can't catch up, doesn't give you enough time to make a pass. Please fix the issue with connection and the lagging.. It is a game with a decent gameplay, but too bad after playing for quite sometime i have come to a conclusion that this game is not about the skill. At some point, the game algorithm designed to make you lose.. either by pairing you with a far stronger opponent, or make your player become stupid. The developer hope you to spend money and buy the gem after all.. they need income from the game too and i can understand that. For me only 5 star or 1 star, no in between. so i'm sorry, it's a 1 star. I can't see the names of the bad players, unless they stop without losing the ball. So, it makes too hard to evaluate the players. Meanwhile, penalty decision of the reffere is not logical, it's randomized. Edit: after 6 months it got worse. Another bug is penalty positions. My keeper and opponent is opposite to each other from a distance. No other players in the penalty area. The Opponent shot and missed the goal and decision penalty. Are you kidding guys???. so many things wrong with this game. the offside, fouls seem completely random. there is at least 1 penalty every match. your opponents seem random, as long as they are in the same league you can get matched with literally anyone. if you dont add people on facebook who have high lvl players, you might as well not play at all. the game has potential, but the developers seem lazy and do not care. Ugh! This game really need many more things. Whenever I tackle, there's always penalty or freekick Please do somethin' 'bout it. The field needs to be larger. I'm not even given upgrade cards like before (the first time I installed it) I have to play like ten matches before I get one. My players don't release the Ball quick While other players do. Great graphics n' addictive But don't make me see it annoyin'\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd. You have no control over the game and the players. Every ball that your player has is taken by the opposing team player by tackling. But it is difficult to get the ball from them. Where, when and to whom you want to pass is not in your control. Especially the goalkeeper. Every ball that comes towards your goal scores a goal. There is not even a guide to how it works.. I have never played a game where you get penalised for winning so much! You progress into the next arena and then you lose the next 3 or 4 games, back down to the previous arena, win, get promoted then matched with better teams, demoted and so on! The algorithm in this game is ridiculous! Also, commentator keeps saying to change tactics but there is no option to do that during the game! Just played 15 games in a row v players of higher rank, give us a chance ffs! Uninstalled as too frustrating. They asked me to give an honest review. Honestly, this game was fun at first, but then it just started making me mad. I've downloaded many football games like this, but nothing has made me mad as this. The graphics are fine, but JUST THE TACKLING. When I tackle the enmy, it is most often considered as a foul, whereas if the opponent tackles me, it always says advantage played. And when I do a simple pass to my teammates, they just move back instead of controlling the ball.

I love the graphics, it has really good challenges. It gets really difficult at times, but tha5s what makes it even more fun. I would suggest the developer to put more content around the story lines. I personally would love to see more drama, and intrsting events. Take it to the next level, build walking ALs and would love to see town and free driving must not focus only on a straight line road, give it more channels, and options. Play around with introduction of towns.. This is best Car Racing Game. But please remove that Clean Drive stage in Chapter 5. It's impossible to win it. If the stages becomes too difficult it's spoils the game. And in higher stages reduce the congestion of cars. You can't enjoy the speed of the car. Work only on those two and people will enjoy it. I've stopped playing this game because I can't win that stage it's too difficult.. This game is exactly what I always wanted to play on phone. Racing through the traffic with real opponents, many real cars (with fake names tho), lots of content in very nice graphics. Singleplayer includes an actual story. There is also multiplayer. Unlike other games, this one is very player-friendly. It doesn't hold you back from playing. The fuel recharges in a few minutes. Instead of waiting tens of minutes for a car upgrade you can watch ads. There is also DeLorean. Brilliant!. really great racing game. there is a good story which you can follow or just go for a ride along the highway if you wish. the game play and graphics are really good, I love the sparks flying up if you hit the barrier, which I never do lol \ud83d\ude01. having the races at different times of the day is also a good challenge, as is the road not always being on the flat. all in all a real winner for me. Gorgeous, realistic graphics. Controls are adjustable. Upgrades are not priced unreasonably. Choice of several different scenarios including racing, duels or just cruising.(Yes, you can just cruise all those nice scenery graphics.) A lot of wrecks, pile ups and general mayhem, depending on how well you do with controls...or if you want the mayhem on purpose. I drove part of one race with a cop car on my hood. LOL... GREAT FUN!. This game is so cool good graphics and a great storyline . I like the way you can earn money so easily and i like the choice of the cars. The distracting cars are a really cool thing it makes the game vrey realistic . The copa are a really good add to the game and the better thing is that they show up out of nowhere , the game play is ow , amazing it leaves me speechless, tongue tide o just have no words. The characters are so interesting and good .the controls are very very good and easy to use. this game is amazing. from the graphics, to the gameplay, the modes, the cars, the realism and even the money. that's a huge up factor here since most games get boring when you can't make money easily. has a plot which makes the game all the more interesting. adds are minimal....all in all its the perfect free street racing game......5/5. I agree 100% with the ratings of previous players and devs did a really good job in making this game. I have played this game for a week now and it's fantastic. Ads don't slap you in the face, \"buy this, buy that\" unlike other racing games. Also, the upgrades of cars are cheap but then there's still the element of grind to beat a certain level. There's also no unrealistic flying car stunts so it's just pure racing game. Wish you could add more variations in the map, to make it more challenging.. It's the best car game I have ever seen.So I love this game so much . It's better than Need for Speed.Its the best car game on Android. And also very smooth performance of this game. Awesome! and best graphics . I love it so much. Just add more cars . Such as SUV,s and more. Hey and please add the Scorpio car of India. And please add the horn . Then it will be more realistic and fun to play.. This is by far one of the best racing games I've come across. It isn't a pay-to-win racing game. You earn and buy everything in-game with in-game currency, although there are things you can choose to buy with real world currency. This is a really fun game and doesn't get old. It has a great storyline and isn't too hard to progress. It has side races which make money easy to come by and cars are perfectly priced. Graphics are great and very in depth, and controls are equally as good. Good Job!. Hey its actually one of the best racing games i ever played \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 wonderfull.... Please add multiplayer to play with our close friends. There is a built in multiplayer function in thay we can play in online friends... Only selected no of peoples from online... I want to play with my own friend but the option is not there... Plz add in update. Exceptional. Easy to play. Great features. Great graphics. Reasonable instruction. Finish the game 3 times now and counting. One of the best mobile racing game.. Offline and online. The only thing that sucks about the is that you can't get enough of it and the chapters only 13..can you do something about that.. I recommend it to anyone because it's worthwhile your time and money(data). Best Highway Game I have ever played. The graphics \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c... game play is also on point... I love how you can move the controls to be how you want them to be... Cars are affordable. THE BEST PART of this game is the LONG DRIVE...\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b damn... well done to the developers and I hope you will continue creating such games. This is the best game thus far for me in 2020. This game is the best racing game in the world, it's sounds, graphics,look, setting,matches is amazing, I don't have words to explain it's features. I am very Happy for download this game and playing in my micromax canvas HS2 . In the end one things is best that is it's absolutely Free of cost. Thanks you car X technology. I just started playing this game and it's already so fun! It's kinda like playing Need for Speed on your phone and a really cool feature is that you can play the game with a controller. It would be nice to have unlimited fuel though and a few more types of cars like Lambo, Mclaren, Porsche etc. would be nice! Something else that would be really cool is if you could add friends and challenge them like you can in other multiplayer games.... Thanks CarX Technologies, amazing game!. This is good. I've never tried the whole \"highway racer\" thing, but this has to be one of the better ones - at least on a phone. Its got me wanting to relive my \"Grid\" glory days on their other game. Its all drift. I personally think they need to make a rally or sport truck title. I'd like to see what they can do.. Nice game and graphics are great. I know this might be too much but might i suggest a few things like a steering wheel controller, body customization (adding different body kits), and maybe an option for specific car customization (wheel traction for rear and back wheels, body lowering/heightening, accelaration over topspeed, etc.... i know this might be too much to ask but just suggestion hehe). Overall great game and I would recommend this to everyone looking for a great racing game.. The Graphics are Great, but when you race the ghost cars its annoying when you cant keep up when they drive straight through the other cars on the Highway & you cant. And also the incar camera action is Damn Frustrating. Seldom do you get 4th. place. Beware of the Cop car, it will run you off the road & into the Guard Rail or other cars on the Highway. All & all its a Great Experience. Update : Every car that i Purchace Still Misfires. You cant beat this game. But its fun trying !!!. So disappointed because I love this game but glad I didn't renew my subscription. The last upgrade in Google Play shows the installation progress at 100% but stops there not re-installing the game. Now the game won't open because your forced to do an upgrade that won't completely finish. Anytime there's a bug fix there's more problems not allowing the user to play. This makes no sense because logic would dictate their programmers test any changes for problems before releasing the upgrade.. Must say this game was a pleasant discovery. It reminds me of the Need for Speed games on PS2. Like most wanted. Story mode is decent. Graphics are good for the type of game it is. I have experienced no glitches. No annoying ads every two seconds. Racing gives you plenty of money so you dont have to always buy something to have a good experience. Only knock is the car selection is kind of weak and the horsepower ratings for the cars are so inaccurate lol. Other than that. Great game to play.", "neg_reviews": "Developers still have not fixed glitches. In Knockout races you still end up losing even before the race finishes! E.g. If you're 2/3 placed, then cross the knockout line (yellow line) and become 2/2 then the game thinks you have lost the entire race and \"fails\" you even though there's still one more leg of the race left (before the red line)!! Is this some type of plot to waste players fuel thus forcing them to buy more or watch ads to get more fuel?!? Why have the developers not fixed this?!. It has awesome controller support. The game works great on my Razer Kishi. It's clear a foreign language port so some of the English is amazing. The downfall, and a major one, is the multiplayer. It uses ghosts that are racing the same track but with different traffic conditions. Sometimes the car ahead looks like a ghost and it's a real car so you catch. Other times it puts you in a group you can't win so it's miserable. It's frustratingly bad.. I hate this game! You need fuel to play a level! You only add that because you wanna get some money, the game is not worth it to buy premium. and the controls is the problem too, there is no wheel steer only arrows and tilt. Please remove the fuel thing and add something in the controls, this game would've been great to be honest, I'm uninstalling this game. This game is just a money grabber.. These guys are straight thieves. I have been playing the 7 day challenge and trust me, you can't win without spending real money. I have been spending since the beginning of the challenge. Every time you win a car, the game crashes and you lose the car you won with real money. Developer, I hope you read all these comments, it's either you fix this or delete your game and stop charging people. I'd rate it -5 but I can't cause there isn't that option. Why do we lose our cars when the app crashes?. I had a wonderful experience playing this game. Graphics support everything was perfect. But all of a sudden I am not able to play it. Everytime when I start the game it gets stuck in the initial screen itself. Once it shows progress as 100% it stops there. So I reinstalled it and downloaded the progress. However still the same issue exists. If this issue is fixed then will increase the rating.. Stupid game. 90% of multiplayer servers is full of bot racers. It is just impossible to beat them even with fully upgraded cars.....unless that route has a hard curve and the bots act like retard drivers during hard turns. The game is also very expensive in every way but they also give you fair chance to continue playing without spending any money(be patient). But when it comes to multi-players, not a single racer is real. All bots and coded in such a way that they are impossible to beat.. This game was absolutely fine in the first two months, Now i'm facing some serious difficulties to play this game. No 1 is then I start a race its starts giving hang. Its like buffering. I can't feel any smoothness in this game nowadays. I have enough space in my phone but all the time this game create hang/unusual stops & everything like this. Please give some update & fix this problem. I just loved CarX Highway. Don\u2019t let it fade away. Good luck. I have made 3 purchases within the game and have not recieved the cash or 3 star upgrade. Two purchases were for $19.99 and the other was $1.99. Not sure if its a glitch within the game, but its kinda of messed up that the game company takes your money and does not give you what you bought. So until i get what i purchased i rate it 1 star.. I think the game is pretty good until you get half way through the story, then you pretty much have to spend money or grind for very long time in order to continue playing because can only used specific cars that can't be bought with in game cash. Also, can't open any chests from multiplayer rewords, some kind of bug I guess. Tried contacting developers several times via email and got no response.... Special race events are a joke. Tried every one. Impossible unless you want to spend lots of money to win a rebadged version of an actual car. I finally did what I should've done a long time ago. Happily deleted! And as I said Money Pit. Better race apps out there to be had like Gear Club. Playing that one for 5 years now and it never gets old.. yet another great game ruined by this awful \"energy\" system. game is beautifully done, with good controls, but like so many other games on the play store, is plagued by this awful new trend of having to spend money just to fully enjoy the game. 2 stars for the game being well programmed, 3 stars off for following the ugly trend that plagues mobile games today. paying a one time charge like 5 bucks would have been fair, paying 50 bucks a year for full access just seems greedy for a mobile game.. Could've given lowest rating but the gameplay is good so two stars. In the event of the latest car that is introduced, the game is unjust and unfair to me in terms of money (which is made by every race). Numerous times the game has given me money 10k less than it should have. And therefore it is too much hard to win the car. Hope you fix this issue. I have been playing this since last three years.. When I first downloaded this game, in May of 2021, I loved it. However, I have been experiencing multiple issues. I have reported these issues through the game numerous times without any resolution. The issues are 1. The steering is getting stuck, you can't steer the car. 2. I don't receive tickets anymore for the cars that you can only get by acquiring these tickets. Since May I've acquired only 2 cars with tickets. No tickets in months. 3. In multiplayer qualification race keeps repeating.. This game is absolutley time wasting it's literally the same thing over and over. This game will never be good unless they add some more objectives, better stories, better vehicle's, this game is just to basic. A basic game for all of the basic players.. Guys! Seriously, During 7 days challenge. It happened many times that if you lost the race It is ok! but if you won.. GAME CRASHED. Ticket Lost , race lost and more important. INTEREST Lost.! Thats why I am not spending real money on you. One more crash during challenge. You will be UNINSTALLED for sure. And I am not the only one who is having issues like this. Cheaters!! It happened again and I just UNINSTALLED.! Thanks Carx. Cheap Algorithm prevents you from completing the event. The game starts crashing in last stages of every event... And mostly, when you buy the tickets from the event coins. \"SOMETHING WENT WRONG\" is the most common error will be flashing on your screen after you win the races as you proceed towards the end of the event. Repetitive races are no good once you clear all the chapters. There's no fun in the long drive or free run... Atleast a cop chase would have brought some fun to it.. There was a free subscription of 3 days which I had availed on 26th Nov .. and as I was learning the game and didnot find it okay, I unsubscribed before the same xpiry of 3 days i.e by 28th morning .. but today I found INR 250 has been deducted from my account .. why is that so ? Please initiate bthe refund as the Subscription was cancelled well before time. Bought premium access subscription and it has stopped working after the last update. Lost my unlimited fuel, coins, containers and other premium benefits. I have contacted the developers several times but to no avail. I have cancelled my subscription and received a refund from play store. Such a shame as I was really enjoying the game but this has put me off.. I bought premium monthly and after the latest update, my premium is gone, when I click on the monthly one again, it says I purchased it already but nothing changed, I don't get my free stuff and the premium things, please fix this! I really like the game and also please make the event cars more easier to get or like purchasable with in game money or coins after. And now that I restarted the game several times, I cancelled my subscription. Now I won't be able to finish the story because the cost!. I find problems with a number of things about this game. I nearly uninstalled right after i opened it considering you can't skip the intro. Next, you can't turn off the music until AFTER you've done all the trainings. There are 2 black avatars on the game. One looks like an idiot with his hair twisted and the other looks like Mr T. I will definitely be deleting this game. I can't believe i waited this long to do it.", "pos": "Negative reviews:\n- Clean Drive stage in Chapter 5 is impossible to win, making the game less enjoyable.\n- Higher stages have too much congestion, hindering the enjoyment of the speed of the cars.\n- Some players have stopped playing due to the difficulty of certain stages.\n- Some users find the in-car camera action frustrating and struggle to keep up with ghost cars that drive straight through traffic.\n- Issues with game upgrades not completing installation, preventing users from playing.\n- Limited car selection and inaccurate horsepower ratings are disappointing for some players.", "neg": "Negative reviews summary:\n- Glitches in Knockout races causing players to lose unfairly.\n- Multiplayer experience frustrating with ghost cars and unfair groupings.\n- Requirement of fuel to play levels seen as a money grab.\n- Issues with game crashing and freezing during races.\n- Problems with in-game purchases not being received.\n- Difficulty spikes in the game, forcing players to spend real money.\n- Unresponsive developer support to reported issues.\n- Unfair game mechanics in special events and multiplayer races.\n- Premium subscriptions not working after updates.\n- Inability to skip intro and other frustrating game design choices.", "summary": "-", "features": "-", "adjectives": "-", "search_term": "-"}, "com.naquatic.monstercrafter": {"app_name": "MonsterCrafter", "description": "THE SEQUEL TO GUNCRAFTER!\n\n\u2022 DREAM IT.

It's a game where you create your very own imaginary monsters... you can can go to battle with the monster(s)you had created! You also play with your monsters like Fetch,\"Lottery Machine\",Rock Paper Scissors,all that kind of things you could play with your monsters! There also is Clans and PVP stuff like and I'd love to support this!! Thank you very much for this game!! I never find CREATIVITY without this game. I've been playing this game on and off for a long time, and it never seems to disappoint me. I just recently downloaded it once again and I must say I'm once again addicted! 10/10, I've shared it to my younger siblings and they're obsessed too! The graphics are suitable for everybody; colorful enough for the younger audience, and the style is amazing and can be appreciated for an older audience. \u2661\u2661. Ive always seen this game in the app store and thought it was a Minecraft knockoff because the icon looks like a grass block. It should be a monster to catch attention better. Anyway I absolutely love it. you can make anything you want and fight. Building is very simple and responds well. no major complaints except the camera is very shakey in battle making it a chore to collect coins and health. This game has been around for a while and I wish I downloaded it sooner.. Most of this might just be nostalgia, but I overall love this game. I find this game a lot more fun when you play with friends (if aplicable). And the part where you build the monsters is arguably the best part. It let's your creative side flow and I love that.. Even playing this game after 4 years it really sparks nostalgia and joy! The creature customization is great, (although permanent blocks and inability to change names for editing is a bit rough, but understandable) and the fights are short but easy and fun! I really hope to see more added to this game to keep it fresh! (And it's hard to care for creatures when you run out of money, that could use some tweaks to make it easier, and being able to remove one permanent block per level? Thanks. I really enjoy the unique aspect of creating and playing with our own monsters. I feel like the game is very solid, and there aren't any unskippable or forced ads at all. The battling gets a little repetitive, but I still find it engaging. The only thing I'd ask for in this game is a 'reward ad' in the shop, so players can choose to watch an ad for some coins or a gem.. This App is really fun! The mechanics are easy to understand and implement, yet still is creative. It brought back a lot of nostalgia, though I certainly don't remember names like pengorool the long or indestructible ooze murderer \ud83e\udd23 (I'm not trying to badmouth your naming system) One thing I do encounter, however, is that every time I get matched up in online fights, it's usually someone else who has a monster 2 levels higher than mine. Other than that, it's really good!. Loved this game. I just wish there were more types, and I wish there would be a bigger variety of parts for monsters, it could impact the game immensely. Also I think there should be a pricing system for monster eggs, like if you buy two of the same type, but for different prices, in which the higher costing egg grows in a better way, stat-wise, than the lower costing egg. Overall, I've just loved the concept of the game and I think the developer/s can find a way to make the game better.. This game is awesome. I have three monsters and love all of them. BUT, there is only one problem, you may not consider it a very relevant one but it's very annoying when you like to listen to music you selected while playing. I only wish there was a way to mute the game so the music wouldn't interfere with the music I'm trying to listen.... This game is AMAZING! Super addictive and a 9.5/10! I love how you can build monsters of your own! Just one question; why is the background for each of the dungeons a Minecraft cave with a tinted color?. Honestly, I think this game is so fun! I like how you can design your own monster and battle other monsters. But something's bothering me, on some blocks you can't put eyes or anything on it, what's up with that? Still giving it 5 stars, though!. This game is amazing. It may not look like it first, stylized like minecraft and gameplay similar to pokemon, but this is a masterpiece. You build your own monster that has different stats depending on its type and how build it. You play with it, play the campaign that has an energy system that replenishes fully after 5 or so minutes. Great game, check it out.. God, I remember back so many years ago when I played this game. This was perfection at its time. My little brother recently found my super old android tablet, and this game was on it, so I downloaded it on my phone. The magic it had when I was so much younger is definitely still there. I adore this game, and thank you devs for building a big part of my childhood!. Its a really fun game, its like pokemon but you build the abominations that you train and love. Not to mention the boss music is awesome. Edit: advice from a (not really) pro, choose grass/plant for your first thingie, because the first dungeon is a water type, and fire for your next thing.. Was great made me cry every time I watched. Best motion picture 2037. I got emotional at the end when Tony Stark got shot by Bilbo Baggins and died (made me cry). Batman is still best character though until he killed Barnie and Baby Bop (so sad). Thanos was a good edition though nice to see amateur actors in a big movie like this. I also like how the scene where Kermit the Frog shoves Baby Bop's ghost and Fortnite Dance Guy Greg off the Eifell Tower (so much adrenaline in that scene).. This game has been around for quite some time, hasn't it? Used to play this when I was younger, and me and my sister would just have a blast taking care of our monsters and fighting in the dungeons. I just wish there was more energy.. Ok I love it I am addicted the only problem is is that when I go to pick up the coins I end up clicking on the enemy so I lose the stuff and don't get the other so I don't know if u can but can u make it Collect automatically or somthing. Other than that it is a great game over all. To be honest this game is pretty good i love it so much that you developers can add more kind of monsters like flesh monster or air monster or gem monster i mean it is really good if you ask me but also add a save some if someone one day they delete it and they want to install it back, instead of starting from the beginning they can start from the previous save i mean it is a good idea and you might get a bit more popular than before. Brings back the nostalgia... and if you update your eggs. I will give it 5 because I know how to remove blocks when you evolve you press the x on the side anyways the game is so cool and so awsome too and the boss battle's are epic. I don't know what you guys are talking but this game is awesome. I like creating and fighting with my monster. I wish I can keep them with me and that they stay with me Evan when this game is gone. I feel happy playing this game it make me excited. you should download this game it awesome and amazing. I hope this game don't get taken out. keel this game. and upgrade it by adding that your progress is save Evan if you delete the game and come back in your progress will be saved please add that.", "neg_reviews": "Yes means no and no means yes. When you get your 2nd monster you dont get it back free so i say its bad. Its cheating! The firstime i played multiplayer My enemies monsters was all lvl 1 and my monsters are Lvl 3 And i got all my best shot and i lost do not download this game its a waste of time and my old account that was bound in to monster crafter.... All my monsters were lvl 8 or 5 Idk and my phone broke! When i log in to my new phone i lost all my progress....It was a hardwork of getting my monsters strong and Hardwork got lost...I was so sad plzz dont download the game its a waste of time. I will give you a 5-star if I get a diamond. (MAKE THE FASTEST WAY TO GET DIAMONDS!). Would ve give it 4 stars but.... This game is approximately really annoying! Never download! Because it resets all of your progress last time l played a different game and gone back into it and it was gone l was wondering why it was glitching go fix this buggy problem !. I would rate it -5 stars if I could. It deleted my profile and now I need to start all over again and I want my monsters back plz respond. Good concept, but the building tool was so poorly designed. What kind of animal is wider than it is long? Why!? Why, when I delete one object, does it delete an object next to it? How the hell did you make this game so horrible? It's like you tried to make it hard. 3 blocks building height? It wouldn't even be that hard to change this. And can you have an arrow that shows which way the monster is supposed to face?. Money wh**es. Honestly, at first I thought this was going to be a cool game, but when i unlocked the clans, everything just stoped. Its not like in every game where you just scroll to enter a clan, you have to know some clan members in real life. Plus, there isn't any global chat where you can invite layers in your clan. This is a multiplayer game, but in the end, its just like if the game was a singleplayer game where you had to pay for the multiplayer version. Dont waste your time on this game.. I noticed you were using the same exact screenshot of a minecraft cave for every dungeon's title thing. The rock-paper-scizzors game and the slot machine are both the most frustrating mechanics in the entire game, mostly because you have to use both of them and win enough times to keep your monsters happy. There's also a \"timer\" mechanic that keeps you from playing for a while to keep you addicted. This game isn't fun, just addictive.. It's so terrible i can't even barf and you don't get your craft anything it's a rip-off also don't download this game because you get to battle and they hear monster dies then you have to respond your monster but it's ok because also you get to make a monster again but still don't download this game. What is wrong with your game it keeps starting a new game every time I exit the app if this is a bug it needs to be fixed asap I've already lost 2 saves because of this this game would be good otherwise but if I can't save my progress and it gets wiped every single time then it's trash. Unfair payment of monster. The game is rarely good but there are a few problems when I play... I don't know how to save because the game didn't say how to and the other games are the same. Until I know how to save I will have this uninstalled.. You should be able to get the 2nd place monster for free if u destroy it I'm rage quiting or even the 1st one. The game will not save. Everytime I exit the app it restarts all my progress. Either the game doesn't have a save function, or I just can't find it. Either the game needs a HUGE update so you can actually save your game, or I just need help finding the save system. Other than this issue, the game is good.. The game is great but i bought 2 thing worth 15 dollars and have not seen any thing but my money is gone. One day I was playing and then I accidentally hit the destroy button on one of my monsters and the interface popped up and said \"are you sure? Yes no\" I hit no and and It deleted my monster. Please fix this issue in the next update you probably won't even look at this message but if you do, please. I like this game and I would have rated it higher if it wasn't for this problem.. i had a fire monster which i decided to evolve. The final built was amazing but apparently when i used it in combat i found out that it was facing backwards. even though it was facing front in the building tab.

They do have opportunities to make cash purchases, but there are plenty of ways around it. You can play levels multiple times to earn coins and diamonds, so you dont have to spend actual money. There are lots of random \"helps\" and events. Im really enjoying it. I play a lot of cooking time management games, and this is the best one i've played in a while!. Fun, challenging, can be free if you strategize. I love how this game builds in learning. Levels get progressively more difficult and some are impossible unless you use boosts and the limited extra time offers, but this is part of the fun. You learn to strategize when to play certain levels in order to capitalize on those gift boosts, temporary boosts, and extra times. I don't mind the ads since I'm getting to play such a visually appealing, fun, challenging game for free.. Fun game. I just hate the timed sessions. Sometimes it feels like they want you to fail just to watch an ad or spend money. I wish I were smart enough to create a hot new game and get . 99c every couple of minutes for additional diamonds or time.. Games was really nice, I tried many cooking games, this is the best ever. First the loading was very slow, I contact them and rectify immediately.... They service is really admirable... (Really I don't think that I will get response from the help center\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude05. But they did help me... What a great service!). Love this game. The only thing I wish were different is the amount of diamonds you can earn and how many you need to use for boosters. It should be more diamonds that you earn and less diamonds needed for boosters. Other than that it is a great game.. I can't stop playing! The ads aren't intrusive, they give a fair opportunity to earn the coins and gems without spending money but the game is so friggin addicting, I'll probably end up spending some anyway! It's super fun and plenty challenging. Love love love!. Just started playing. I'm used to cooking fever and it's sort of the same only in this game you tap the meal that's done and it automatically sends it to the customer who ordered it first versus cooking fever where you have to drag the meal to each customer. I like both games. thumbs up. Tons of fun, very addicting. I wish I didn't run out energy so fast because I want to keep playing. It would be cool to have teams to give you more energy. Or have competions against other players to gain energy other then purchasing energy.. Only just started playing but its very entertaining. I saw other reviews complaining about ads, but so far the ads have been optional. You can choose to watch an add after a game play to double your winnings and can choose to watch an ad for a \"mystery prize\". I have been able to skip the ads if I don't want to watch them, however it is a easy way to upgrade equipment faster. Not sure if this changes the further you get in the game but ads have not been an issue so far.. what i love about it is that i just have to tap it to cook and serve. compared to other games that u need to drag the food u cook to serve which makes it even more challenging for u to do the level. i want a game that i will enjoy playing not make me have a difficult time to play with it :). By far one of the best time management cooking games around! It's right beside of Cooking Craze for me an I've been a loyal player to that game since 2014-15! Please keep up the awesome work! I love this so much!! Thank you for making it!!!!!. Top notch cooking game! Lots of similar cooking games don't balance the challenge right with new restaurants and get boring quickly but this game mixes special events, new challenging levels, and smaller mini events to keep things engaging. It's easy to earn plenty of gems and boosts using the daily tasks and streaks so you don't have to spend money. The pop up ads are reasonable. I just wish there was a way to pay gems to play past events! You could pay like 500 gems and get 2 weeks to win. The game is so addictive that I am done playing all the levels I am just waiting for the developers update hopefully it won't take that long, there are ads and that's totally ok it helps for the game to create a money and it helps the player to win the levels as well..please create more levels and worlds please.... I love the game.. I rate it 5 stars because i love the challenges.. But\ud83d\ude01, it doesnt conect me to the server.. My game is upgraded with the last version.. I updated it on the 21 of september.. And it still doesnt let me play, its loading until 10% and that is it.. What can i do?. Another great game again! Hard to find, thank you for your hard work is paid off as this game is great it's fast (but not too fast), it also is packed with lots fun. Highly recommend to others! Download guys you won't regret it. I'm terminally ill and this game keeps mind off of my worries so whenever I'm anxious I just put on this game and chill. Moto G6 play user.. Great game to pass time. Daily rewards and \"extra jobs\" to earn more diamonds. Absolutely wonderful to find a free game and be able to advance levels without having to buy anything.. Best cooking game ever! This is the first time me leaving a review! The game keeps you motivated to travel the world and discover new cuisine ! One comment it would be nice if the customers will change from one country to another..also it would be nice if we can take the money we raise to the next country.. other than that, perfect. And the boosters are just amazing.. **8/2/21 UPDATE** I stand corrected. Option to buy extra boosts with diamonds were exactly where programmer stated it was moved to. Changed rating to 5 stars bcuz I appreciate the quick response and I really do like this game**FROM 7/20/21~Unless I'm missing something...I just did the latest update for this game and now I'm not seeing where you can buy extra boosts using just diamonds. I only see to buy extra boosts, you have to use real money. I can tell you now...THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!!. Cool game! Has a nice flow to it! And if you dont want your child to serve wine on a game be the sdult and monitor your children's activity like an adult! I recommend everyone should try this game! Have fun!. It's an excellent game, keeps my attention,but just like all of the games they make you make some type of purchase. Do no this game is not free.", "neg_reviews": "It's a fun game. But, I've made it to level 105 in France and I have to wait and wait and wait! I need gems and/or boosts! Some of the levels cannot be completed without a boost, which is BS in my opinion!!! Levels should be hard to complete, but not impossible without extras. I've read most of the reviews and the replies to them and...no, sorry but no. Some of the levels just cannot be completed without extras and having to wait for days to get the extras or gems makes it a whole lot less fun!. Basically, the game is fun and quite addictive. But the white noise of the fountain is annoying to me, it makes me dizzy. And the ads is way too much. Been trying to play one more time.. and another ads.. i understand you need it to improve the game, but there are games out there that has less ads than this.. at least not every few levels, for nothing. I am sorry, i am uninstalling, forgetting how good it was.. Could be fun but it autoplays ads for no reason at random times (there's plenty of ads for double rewards, etc) and even though you are supposed to replay levels, every time you finish a level, it bumps you back up to the highest level so it makes it super annoying to try to complete all levels at three stars. Literally the same exact gameplay as other games but more annoying. If you like watching ads over playing, this game is for you. The more you progress the more ads and then they start appearing back to back where you have to watch 2 or 3 ads in a row all 30 seconds long each before allowing to play one more round and then the ads return. It's to bad as it's a fun game but the ads are way out of control. \ud83d\ude35. The game is good but the developer is very clever. I have been playing the game perfectly and now I am in a stage where I must buy. I can fast serve the dishes without throwing or burning any. I didn't even lose any customer but they on purpose give me less no of customers. I have to clear 19 orders but you only get 16 customers the only way to clear this level is to buy more customers. This was a big let down for me and I decided to remove the game.. The gameplay it's great and the graphics are nice. However, I'm at level 36 and the game is becoming too difficult. At first it was relaxing to watch the steaks sizzle before serving them to the customers. Now it is all about how fast you can be. Even with all the upgrades and multiple boosts. I still can't beat it. It's frustrating and sad. Uninstalling.. Update: Game forces you to repeat levels to win the keys and becomes impossible to win without spending money much too quickly. Rating downgraded from 3 stars to 1. This is a stressful, frustrating game and just not worth the effort. Original Post: I love this game but hate that it forces you to use enhancements that you would prefer to keep for more advanced levels. I am perfectly capable of understanding the directions, let me play the game the way I want. Also, there are way too many ads.. I wish I could have given it a zero, because I'm tired of it taking all my gems when the game pauses, when the videos during the game freezes and it makes me lose that level, or the 10 times I tried to play it tonight and it just went back to home screen. you have one week to fix the bugs that I've been complaining about for three months now or I will be deleting this game. Game is good till the 3rd restaurant. Gets really hard, to the point where you have no choice but to use boosts in order to win the level. Yes, you can earn diamonds, but you eventually run out and have no choice but to purchase them in order to pass. The pictures above don't match how the game really plays either. No matter what they write in response to this review, nothing will change. They got you this far in the game so they made their money on ads we watched and will move on. Once you get to France Level 6, it is IMPOSSIBLE to beat this Combo levels without diamonds, and it is impossible to get 200 diamonds to slow the timer down, without using real money to purchase diamonds, unless you want to wait 6 months to get 200 diamonds. It was such a fun game up until this point. I hate when programmers get greedy. Now I have to UNINSTALL.. I would have given this game 4 stars. I was on the 3rd world,I spend some money on this game to get there,it asked me to updated,I did. When I tryed getting in it just kept freezing,so I uninstalled and installed again, and to my horror it took me right back to the 1st world level 1! I'm very disappointed!!!!!!!!. This game is good fun for a little while until you hit the point where some levels can only be won by gathering enough of the \"combo\" points. Here it becomes impossible to beat without the booster which slows down the combo counter... You need to save up diamonds to buy these or pay real money to buy more of them usually. It's seriously frustrating that it seems impossible to win these levels without the booster. Having to give up on this one and I'm only a little way into it.. Good and addictive game. But now just irritating. For some levels if we don't use diamons or ads can never pass that level. Want to be difficult, but this is too much. Even after upgrading all the properties cannot pass some levels. Also when we lose the level it comes to use add 30 sec more for 100 diamonds.... thinking of uninstalling.. i can't open it, it said failed to extract resources needed by II2CPP i just downloaded it.. i did nothing.. after downloading the app i open it and failed to extract resources needed by II2CPP pop up when i touch the screen of my phone i got back to my home screen i repeated it not once or twice.. i hope it will be fixed i would loved to play this game... ADS! ADS! ADS!!!..I just started playing this game. Overall, the game would be enjoyable however, there's just TOOOO MANY ADS! In order to earn gems, you have to watch, not one ad but, a couple of them. To earn coins, in order to upgrade, you have to watch, MORE ADS! There's just too many ads to practically do anything! You're basically watching more ads than you are actually playing the game. Just finished LVL 3 and I'm already UNINSTALLING! I gave one star for the little time I actually played. Pay to Play. Like most games, once you reach a certain level you have to pay or watch endless ads. I guess FREE is only for a limited time. I wish you could just buy the games flat out and be done with this money grabbing shaming of people. All these game apps are that way. Fun for a while but then you pay and it adds up really quick \ud83d\ude15. This game was awesome until I got to the 3rd restaurant. Had to buy diamonds and soon after the game won't even load. Just a black screen. Have tried multiple times. I can play my other games just fine. If it wasn't for this I would have given 5 stars. I loved it....... When it worked. Pretends to be free to play, but is actually pay to win. For example, there are levels where you need to have x happy customers, but the total customers that are going to come in is less than x and you need to pay to get more. Will not increase rating unless all levels are crossable without paying.. This game is just after your money. Eventhough, you already upgraded all your kitchen tools you really cannot pass the level unless you will use boosters which will need real money to buy it and its always like that. So i deleted the game and found new one which is actually much better than your game and i will recommend this new game to my friends and family. Make your game much better as well next time. You are just after our money!. Would've given it more stars, butsome levels cheat you. I get having to upgrade and occasionally use a booster to help. What I don't get is how in the beginning french levels some are impossible. I'll have the customers in and out quickly&be on top of everything, yet somehow my last customer arrives right when the time runs out? I don't even see the order? I KNOW I was not slow on these levels, especially since they're in the early teens of the French. Why is my last customer so late? That's low", "pos": "Users appreciate the easy and addictive gameplay, the ability to earn coins and diamonds without spending actual money, and the challenges that require strategic thinking.

My only problem was the energy. Nobody wants to wait 5 hours for their energy to recharge when they are playing a game.. Amazing game with simple but fun levels that increase on difficulty. My only problem was the energy. Nobody wants to wait 5 hours for their energy to recharge when they are playing a game.. So awesome and so fun! I just love the Idea of a tower defense game that let's you be a part of the game by fighting in the first person as an Archer. Rather then just a regular Tower Defense from where you simply just watch your towers do all the fighting against your opponent instead.. It's a pretty fun tower defense and shooter defense type of hybrid the use of arrows instead of a gun gives it an added later of skill needed to play it the levels have been increasing in difficulty but not too much that it's unbeatable it reminds me of the old arcade shooters very nostalgic. First of all, I need to explain that I'm a fan of tower defense games in general. That being said, I definitely appreciate unique details and experiences in tower defense games. This game allows you to be interactive as well as making you think about how to place and upgrade your towers.. Tried this game for offline gaming and it's pretty good. The controls are very easy and it is challenging. Though levels are pretty short hope they will be more. Amazing!! Truly works offline and doesn't use data if so. Simple but fun! Doesn't take up much storage aswell!! \u2728\u2728\u2728. The best tower defense game hands down... and not because it tweak it just right, but because it redefines and balances each aspect of powering up your towers with properly attributing your own aiming skill to the equation. The perfect mix, and levels and not just straightforward... this is clearly something no asian could create, only copy - bc thats all impassionate robots are good for.. Nice. Nice...really, really nice. Not only does it take a whole diffent spin on tower defense -it also keeps things noce for the player. The towers could be better (not the focus in this game(kinda nice)). The nemies...fun! This game can improve but its pass the point where it qualifies as a good game. So, great game 5/5.. It's really a lot of fun. A great take on the tower defence format, but more engaging and active. Normally I would be pretty impatient with all the ads and little upsells, but their team really spent a lot of time working out the user experience with that. Timing is appropriately placed where it's relevant to the ingame action, and not to obtrusive. Very fun!. ABSOLUTELY IS AN AWESOME GAME THAT CAN BE PLAYED ON OR OFFLINE WHICH IS A SUPER HUGE PLUS AND IT RUNS SMOOTHLY FR FR THE PRICING FOR ITEMS WITH IN-GAME CURRENCY OR REAL WORLD CASH IS MORE THAN DECENT THIS GAME IS SO MUCH ADDICTIVE FUN ID LIKE TO PLAY IT ON CONSOLE WITH AN ADDED 2 PLAYER MODE ALONG WITH IT AND MAYBE SOME ADDITIONAL LVLS ***\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18***GREAT WORK TO THE TEAM AND THEIR PERSISTENCE WITH CUSTOMER CARE AND FURTHERING AN ALREADY GREAT GAME TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE SWEET THANK YOU SO MUCH!!. It's a great game for offline I can use this in the car it's really fun all you do is battle if you like battle games get this 1!. If you take my opinion it is a really good game I have ever played offline...I just want to give a ' Thumbs Up'...And you should play this game...I just feel that it was the best offline game ever played..Good job to this game. A wonderful game which I played ever. Graphics are too good. All the enemies are really hilarious.. I like to play archery based games,in mobile phone I found only few offline games which were good,when I played this game I liked the game play but developers should further improve the game graphics,rest all other things are extremely good.. Game is fun and simple. Kudos to the devs for creating an entertaining game. You don't have to pay to win and I like that. A good little time waster.. Great graphics and control. Fun game to play on your free time.. Good game. A test of skills and strategy to win. Free items after playing a video are really helpful in upgrading your items.. Another smashing game by genera games. I play almost all of the genera games ninja dash \ud83d\udca8, cover fire \ud83d\udd2b, and now skull towers \ud83d\udc80. As u know i L.O.V.E \ud83d\udc9e ur games as do i love this game having a archer \ud83c\udfaf game is a nice change of pace.evry thing is perfect gameplay / graphics of this development is T.H.E best\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4c. I spent 5 hours, downloading the best games I encountered on a search the fill my new device with games I like. I reeled in 20 games and had to find the best of the best to keep in a second round of critiquing and this game came up early and I felt it in my chest gladness how well I liked it cause I had really found a cool game I really liked! I love archery anyways but I get to feel my might with successful arrow shots as I lead and strike those skeletons down! Like this a lot! Thanks guys!", "neg_reviews": "The game is fun but you have to watch excessive ads to get the full game experience. Like watching an ad to open a chest then watching another ad to get some items from the chest. The worst part of this is the bugs. If your ad fails to start you need to restart the whole game. That happens quite a bit. I'm taking back the 5 star rating since it seems to me like the devs have just given up trying to fix the issue with not being able to load advertisements to open chests. There are several other similar complaints here and so far I don't see anything being done about it.. Don't really know what to rate it. Won't stay open long enough for me to play, much less rate so 1 star on everything. I would give it zero stars but that is not an option. What a shame. Greedy devs ruining a decent game. Don't even bother starting to play - the cost of upgrades means you'll be paying serious $$$ to make any real progress. Uninstalling. No change to rating but more detailed review: 1) too many ads/ads don't always work 2) end game difficulty is insane (how are you going to have a TD game where the towers aren't useful?) 3) sometimes arrows don't fire (huge issue) 4) leveling past level 6 is massive gold; should be about half that 30,000 in this game would take weeks to get things up to level 7 and even then I'm not sure I'd be able to kill anything 5) to unlock final items, you need more stars than what are possible to get.. Control of arrow is horrible. Each touch moves the circle somewhere else and alot of times it puts under your finger and you cannot see it to shoot. The circle fades in and out. I made it to level 2 and could not kill them because of the controls. I had full arrows and more then enough fire power but no control.. Update; the amount of mandatory adds has gotten ridiculous. I'm about 1 add away from uninstalling. It's really disappointing. It's a Fun game. But $6 a week for no adds. If it was 6 a month, would be worth it maybe. Also, they haven't added levels in well over a year.. Love that you can play offline like when flying. Wish the bow/arrow descriptions etc showed up when picking them for a fight. Hard remembering all the bows /arrows and their bonus when selecting.. Level 14 is bugged at mine. Even though i already finished all the waves it won't let me through to the next level how many times i tried. It just let me stare at empty stage forever. And when the game required energy when you want to challenge a stage it becomes double annoying. Pls fix. Energy finishes after every 4 or 5 matches. Due to this I hate this game. Please make energy 100.please developers. After this game will be very good. Dye to this I gave it 2 stars It is the main problem.. big peice of poop. everytime i get up to level 14 and beat it on the 3rd round it sits there doing fk all but wont let me progress. waste of time and effort. After the game crashed 3 times, I'm deleting it. The graphics are great but what good is looking good when it can't be played.. I'll give it 5 stars if you can fix my upgrades I paid for and never got. Never recieved a refund for the gold and gems I spent on them. This has happened a few times. Other than that great game.. aiming is atrocious.. and it's geared for a pay to play.. and save me your generic reply... you know damn well it is.. I dl'ed this on my phone and no matter what I do it won't allow me to switch between neither bows nor bracers both of which are required to complete certain quests. It is extremely frustrating and if it doesn't very soon work for me I will not play again. I dl'ed it on my tablet to see if it is just a glitch so we shall see. Ad prompts don't do anything after ad plays. can't open special chests, replace arrows, or double gold. So i was basically just tricked into watching ads with no reward. Also, aiming is of poor quality, and firing is too slow, remove the draw charge up and just have it shoot the arrow... Its not realistic in any other way, so why make it take so long to shoot ? Uninstalled. The purpose of this gane just to get your money, you cant proceed in the game without see thousands of advertisment clips or pay for the inventory. Really bad experience.. Sucks. Haven't added levels since it came out even though it states \"levels coming soon.\" Don't bother with this game and should be taken off play store. Ad placement is infuriating. Two thumbs way down.. Bow is nearly impossible to aim and fire accurately. I have tried pressing where I want it to shoot (should be how it works but isn't) . when I drag the shot sight to where i want it, it almost never stays there and often my sight veers off to the far side of the screen and I miss by a mile. Pretty well unplayable the way it is now.. Not offline game. Not working well without internet.acutally it stopped working after few levels. fun until around level 17. they dont give you enough tower building material to even start the level and you cant shoot fast enough to finish the levels. replay previous levels 500 times to maybe have enough gold to make it higher than these further levels. until late game it was fun though.", "pos": "Users appreciate the interactive gameplay where they can actively participate as an archer in tower defense. They enjoy the challenge of using arrows instead of guns, which adds a layer of skill. The game is described as a unique take on tower defense, engaging, and not overly intrusive with ads. However, the negative reviews mainly focus on the energy system, with users expressing frustration over having to wait long periods for energy to recharge, impacting their gaming experience.", "neg": "Players express extreme frustration with the game's excessive and intrusive ads, particularly those required to open chests and obtain items. Technical issues with ads failing to load and requiring game restarts are frequent. The upgrade system is heavily criticized for its steep costs, forcing players into either grinding or spending real money to progress. The game's difficulty balance is also a major concern, with end-game levels deemed near impossible due to ineffective towers and overwhelming enemy waves.

Upon being offered the odd weapon at a discounted price, after looking at more info to see how good the weapon is, the price is not lowered. But the text box from the guy saying \"am I sure I want to leave... etc\" is still there indicating the offer is still up. There was an instance where I would have bought the gun with money but couldn't have.. I have downloaded this game several times and had to start over. It is fun even doing the same missions multiple times. It does work better with a mouse than with a laptop pad. Other than that the missions are interesting, and over all the game is a great entertainer and actually takes just the right amount of skill from the beginning and advances well.. Bro, this is the best game I've ever played!! The graphics the controls even the missions they give you are awesome!!! But one thing though, whenever you hold the sniper it moves a little bit, kind of in a circular motion and it gives me a disadvantage to make a clean shot. But other than that, this is a really challenging and fun game!!!. Sniper 3d is really fantastic and It has a better minimum quality. But when I switch the graphics into high it's not at all working. And it has really lots of modes when you reach high level we will get alot missions to play comfortably and it will also leads and came a thought of finishing different kinds of missions Asap. Honestly, I like this game due to countless of guns and mainly it's music it is really nice. But guys it'll take time to finish this game. And also gear stuff is amazing. Great graphics, and I enjoy the many different missions offered. Only issue , sometimes its hard to find the target in the allowed time, this should not be a timed game. When assassin's kill they take there time with no hurry so that the shot is perfect. This game gives you what 10 sec to find and kill target, don't like this aspect of the game at all!!. Just started this game,no long ago,so I'm still getting use to the game myself. But from my experience playing so far, is the game is catchy you don't wanna stop playing, your mission are explained well and straight forward, but still very challenging,me, I love the long shots we make. and the selection of weapons you can win and chose from, is actually very impressive.so if you don't know much about guns, by the time your done playing this game,you will know everything about all kinds of guns.. I LOVE this game. Play it every night. I travel supporting our Service Members worldwide year long and this gives me down time between the craziness. I just would like to progress smoothly without spending so much. Seems unnecessarily greedy at times, especially when it feels like you're paying for your outlet. No Fair. Still enjoy it, but would love to see more perks for regular users.. This app doesn't work very well and often takes money for purchases and then the item purchased just disappears. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4eI may have to give it a \ud83d\udc4dafter I posted my review I Uninstalled the app. Then I reinstalled it the next day and it appears that my account has been fully restored. Just a \ud83d\udc4dfor now, until I am for sure. I'll be back!. This game is so awesome! Very fun and detailed missions & graphics. The controls are pretty easy to maneuver, to focus on, and kill the targets. If you don't have money to upgrade your weapons and energy, there are other ways of doing so, like watching videos or completing missions on other games, that you have to download. But in any case, Sniper 3D is a very fun and entertaining game to play! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf. Dope sniping game. Easy to play, nice difficulty and all around enjoyable experience. Not too many ads either. The graphics are ok, they could be better but it's still passable. It doesnt take forever to upgrade your weapons either. Overall a fun game that's good for a quick pick up during your lunch break or something.. I god dam love it, the graphics aren't the best but the overall gameplay is great, the story line and the missions make you want to play ALL DAY. Yet ANOTHER awesome thing this game does is, when you start out it only tells you to put the target onto the reticle, but the further you get into the game, the more bullet physics are introduced. This makes is really easy to learn the game at a good pace. There are many maps to play too, and many Assault rifles, snipers, pistols and shotguns to choose. The game is fairly simple, aim shoot and repeat. Sometimes the simplest of things can be the most enjoyable. In other words i like the game\ud83e\udd14 and as for helpfull feed back... The miniscule details are what i find important such as the direction of the bullet being shot. The only thing i think you guys need to work on is the details but other than that, good job\ud83e\udd17.. It is a little slow at loading but overall a GREAT game!!! There are NO ADS!!! I love this game so much, it's got just the right amount of effects and the music gets you pumped up AND focused at the same time!! The ingame prices of weapons arent really cool because you dont get that much money on a mission unless you buy premium, but reaching the achievements are fun and the game is great.. Great graphics with easy game play. Premium packages are a bit spendy. But I'll build up the old fashioned way. Through game play,it's that addictive. My favorite feature is being capable of modifying your weapon. Not quite dealing with what they give you. Look forward to hours of game play.. I like how there is no annoying ads after every match, so thank you devs, here's 5 stars for that... -- Enjoyable -- Not bad control, (zooming in slider is uncomfortable) -- Good graphics, don't think you need improvements, this is enough you can improve in other fields -- The bullet sometimes misses the head just by a bit but the calculation is good. I mean it's suppose to hit. Don't care if it doesn't show but the work is done, so,, good. -- Music is cool -- overall 8/10 from me. Love the sniper shooting games. Love it more when it gets more challenging. This one is great for the most part. Just wish the prices were a little more affordable. Maybe someone could make it where you could do special or extra challenges to earn the gun, magizines, bullets, scope, etc,. Some people can't afford extras. But overall still a good game.. Super fun & amazing graphics for using just a phone, never could have imagined this a decade ago that I'd be able to play a video game on my phone with better graphics than my old video game console!! I just wish 1 thing, that I would be able to get upgrades on rifles & packages without having to spend money! It takes a lot of time & missions in order to get enough coins/diamonds to get the really good weapons or even to make upgrades to your own weapon.... Please help me out with something!!. I love this app period!!!!!! It's very challenging and entertaining at the same time...its my best past-timer. Challenging game. Best results obtained with high tier weapons and defensive gear. Can get quite pricey or take many months to years (if you do not wish to buy) to obtain weapons and gear. Downside: too many hacks with highest level weapons and gear. Takes away from ability to reach top levels in events. Otherwise game is much fun especially when member of squad.. This is actually one of the best sniper games it so cool graphics are nice controls are easy the gameplay is smooth and very nice weapons and we can also upgrade them which is nice and i love it because there are missions the missions are very easy and 5 stars for this game i love it!", "neg_reviews": "i loved this game until I decided to spend the 25$ a month on it . The game started to lock up, slow down, whatever you want to call it, it got bad. The bonuses that were supposed to come with monthly purchase were not occurring and the game reached a maximum level quickly. I would have liked to have seen more support by the game creators but it was non existant.. I really wanted to give them 5*. In the beginning I did. I was about to, as they finally attempted to fix the problems in pvp. Their solution didn't work, but at least they tried. Then they introduced a new top weapon. If you do not p2p you can't even come close to getting it. Now if you play pvp you last about 3 secondd before being annihilated. After over 6 mos. of play I am reduced down to beginner level. If you p2p it's a fun time, if not you're screwed.. The game has a huge bug that isnt being addressed. My energy fails to regenerate and all of my weapon upgrades have stopped upgrading. The timer is stuck. The PvP area is also inaccessible, it says 0. I've sent numerous emails to tech support with no reply. This game has a good amount of ads that pop up after each mission most of the time. The concept is great but this bug deters me from playing it. As of March 22, 2019 the game is happily now uninstalled. Still no reply from developers.. Fun at first but A MILLION ads. Plus the \"money\" part of the game gets in the way of enjoying it. Some missions aren't clear they are costing you and every \"deal\" is a way to get you to spend money. If you're a gamer you might enjoy. If you just looking to kill a little time this will get old quick. Sometimes the buttons dont let you shoot. And SOOOOOO many ads. I've deleted the app now.. Quit playing because excessive ads. Sometimes two 30 second ads to play for 15 seconds. Developers need to throttle it back. Maybe only ads for free stuff. Not two ads just to play the game. I used to play every day. I barely play at all now. I log on, play one frame - which takes 10-15 seconds - then close out the app so i don't have to watch the onslaught of ads that will be a minimum of 30 seconds but as much as a full minute. Way too much, developers.. This game was really fun about 5 years ago. Now with the new trophy system changes, they cater to the newer players and promote cheating and hacking with the new unfair trophy changes. Long standing clean players are being forced out of top leagues unless they spend a lot of money to stay there. It's not real fun and it certainly isn't fun after finishing the cities if you are a free player, let alone a paid player.. Always says you have no connection when trying to claim a discounted item but miraculously has a connection when the option is to spend real cash. Also, it offers lots of special weapons for diamonds discounts too, but it's always ten or twenty less than you have. It takes the freemium aspect to the extreme. Also, and this is the worst thing, if you're not careful it will bill your cell carrier. I have no credit card on my phone but it was trying to do anything it could to get real money .. This is not a game but a worthless venture. All the creators want is your money. They are running ads that you cannot skip and goes on for 30 secs. Moreover you will be forced to pay since upgraded items aren't available for free. You will loose out on multiple levels if you don't purchase from them. This is a scam!. It's a fun game for what it is, but the videos that you opt to play to get coins or diamonds don't even play half the time. And like eveyone else has stated, those \"special offers\" for weapons or upgrades or whatever are always just above your current balance, obviously to entice you to spend real cash. And if you happen to have enough, there's always a \"connection problem\" that prevents you from completing the purchase.. Pretty cool game. Good graphics, plot, missions, etc. But unless you pay, real money, for upgrades, the game becomes impossible to progress to the next levels. I dont mind working for some of my upgrades. And I understand the creator of this game is trying to make money for his/her hard work creating this game. But making it impossible to progress in the game and forcing the player to purchase upgrades just sucks!!! Sorry - Uninstalled :-(. Adds adds adds , worst experience I was facing right now , i was playing this game from so long , i have stopped playing sometime , later 3 days before I installed this game from then to till now i have a lots of adds popping up in my screen , when ever you complete a mission it will instantly shows you a add , should I need to continue play this game or else should I stop it , if I was facing this kind of worst experience, do some needul yar , such pathatic experience I was facing. It's a fun game but it's far too costly to be productive and too many glitches to quantify their value. It only takes a couple weeks to progress as far as you can playing solo. There is no way to stay competitive with p2p play without spending a couple hundred dollars. They also have 2 levels of premium. The first merely removes the ads. No other perks. This game tries to be too clever and just shoots itself in the foot {pun intended}. If the designers made it simpler by; removing 90% of the convoluted choices, cut down on the constant ads, and stop asking for money all the time, then maybe the game would be less likely to freeze and aspects like PVP would function ~ it's been unavailable for months and you can't proceed without it, I suspect that this is deliberate when you reach a certain level to try to get you to pay. Uninstalling.. Have played this game off and on for a couple years. It was great....before all the ads. I installed it again recently and discovered the ads are almost unbearable, they slow the game down. For example after a mission, the gun rotates and then just freezes, thought the game froze but evidently that's when the ads start. Won't play near as much with the stupid ads.. Had fun for a few months until I got deep into the game. It became very hard to progress without spending any money. I started to come up against players with deep pockets in the PvP arena. I had to save every point I made to get about 8,000+ defensive points. Started coming up against players with 50,000+ defensive points, getting killed 3-4 times by the same player. The player that bought that many points would be getting 35-40 kills each battle. I gave up. NO FUN GETTING KILLED ALL THE TIME.. Its expensive to keep upgrading, which you will need to pay for, a lot, if you want to advance. If you dont pay then your progression is painfully slow. It's definitely a pay to win game. The best part of the game would be the PVP arena where you battle against other players from around the world. It's a lot of fun. However, its spoilt by hackers and cheats getting 20-30+ kills within 2 minutes. Developers need to heed the feedback from genuine players as it could be a great game. Cheers. It was fun game. A few days ago it quit letting you watch ads to receive gems and energy. The PvP was stupid when I tried it a few times and never did that again. They put you with players way above your level. You use to be able to get some prizes playing their free chance game. You only end up getting red skulls now on the first or second try. Update: Now you don't even get the bonus money for head shots. It's getting worse and worse. Don't play it.. Fun game but it is another need to pay game. Options to buy items with credits received in game consistently (and conveniently for them) give you a connection error. I doubt that would happen if I'm paying money for something. Update: even after paying for items, I was still having server connection issues, tired to uninstall and reinstall, same issues plus it didn't renew my purchases then. Oh well, I'm done with it. Was a waste of money but I should have known better. It is a sucker game!. This game is very addictive and fun. That being said the players that get on here and hack the game with outrageous numbers and a fire rate that when you are trying to compete legitimately within the rules, there's no hope to advance. As soon as the level begins, they are on you instantly and when you are shot with a gun that has 10,000 damage points, you're going to die. I'm seriously considering canceling my premium subscription. Who runs this game devs, you or the hackers?!?. The game itself is fine. My issue is with the ridiculous amount of ads, almost all of which run for 30 seconds and then generste a second ad that runs for an additional 15 seconds before you can close it. An ad will play after almost any action you take and sometimes they will just play without you actually doing anything. Worst of all is that the game also keeps asking me to take some NRA survey. All of this ruins an otherwise decent game.", "pos": "Negative reviews:\n1. Offers discounted weapons but prices not lowered, misleading interface.\n2.

(front and full screen) 1) when re editing cells it will only allow allow me to access # keyboard. Cannot input alpha without closing app and trying again. Sometimes it takes a few tries. Also the cell edit button that was on sheet tab is gone. That was how I could change from alpha to numeric keyboards b4. When I'm in need of a sheet first thing that comes into my mind is Excel. I have changed alot of phone since there's smartphone and also I always have Excel on my phone. Good for memorize important task and list, it helped me alot.

I use this app for everything Edited 3/27/21 This app worked great for a long time, but after some update in the last 6 months or so, I randomly have problems where it says that I'm signed in but won't let me actually open anything. I use this app almost every day, so this is quite annoying, especially since it worked without problems for the year or two before this update.. Excel is my favorite means of organization. I love that you can make Macros easily for commands you use often. It has more functions and options than any other spreadsheet software I've used. It's one of the big reasons I pay for the suite. It is so versatile from managing schedules and finances to table top games and honestly just about anything.. Latest version won't work with Android 11 One UI 3.1 Galaxy Note10+. Cannot save edited files. It just go around in circles asking you where to save. What's wrong with this version? Why won't anybody fix this problem? I can't use Excel in my primary phone. It works only in older or lower model phones. Same account still works seamlessly in Note 9 Android 10 One UI 2.5. UPDATE: Problem FINALLY fixed. Version 1.0.1 (16.0.14228.20138) THANKS.. Very easy app to use. Excel allows me to collect a lot of data about my life (weight, spending, career development activities, etc.). Despite light version there are quite a few functions that you can use. I really need to get my actuary tables on here so it's with me whenever I need them.. excellent application. MS office pro has been one of my PC \"go to\" office suites for years. While I do use other similar spreadsheet apps when collaborating with others who use different suites, I find the excel mobile to be the most universally adopted program. It is easy to use and intuitive. Spreadsheets integrate well across OS platforms and is at home on both Android & IOS devices. The only drawback is: MS does not offer a Windows phone which was totally totally integrated experience.. Sheets and Calc are good. Excel still is the industry de facto standard for spreadsheets, and I doubt that will change anytime soon. It's feature rich and I still haven't mastered Pivot Tables, darn it, but you can get simple things done quickly, and complicated things done with a little more effort. All in all, it's one of the best and most recognized industry software titles out there. I don't think you'll go wrong choosing Excel for your spreadsheet application.. This has been a very useful and experiencing app. I've done multiple resumes, and have 2 jobs now, and have gotten others started in careers, and working my way to the same b/c of it. I'm going to use it for more soon, but I can save and share these files with other apps even as PDFs. Thank you Microsoft.. MS Excel is ground zero for numbers, forms, small databases (upto 100,000 rows), and many other things. For the critical numbers in my business, I have ditched all the 3rd Party Apps for my phone and written them on Excel. It's usability on mobiles is now very good. As for PC use, it's an extremely stable platform to use, and is basically bomb proof. Been using it since 1992. This is one product that Microsoft will never discontinue. One footnote: I use Dropbox over Onedrive. Avoided many probs. MS Excel is the Gold Standard for spreadsheets. While I wouldn't create a file from scratch on the mobile version, I don't believe that's the given intent. I'll initially build a spreadsheet on my PC, with full the Microsoft 365 version, then do edits or modify the sheet(s) on my phone. Excel for Android has amazing functionality presenteted in a clear manner, with little learning curve from desktop. Microsoft regularly adds new features making it even better. I highly recommend it.. I'm pleasantly surprised by how full-featured it has become. Of course the interface takes some getting used to, but there's a definite pattern to it, so that you learn to use the app surprisingly quickly. Definitely worth using if you find yourself putting off data entry, or even just to change posture now and then.. Love it. Of course, I pay for Microsoft 365, however, I love what it gives in return. Amazing speed, OneDrive synchronization and other cool features. When it comes to Excel specifically... Well, I can edit tons of my docs even when I'm in a train or in a bus. That's really great. Also I can track what my team does in these docs and prevent some strange errors that can occure sometimes.. As this was for a phone I originally downloaded it just to view files, but it's turned out easier to use more functional than I thought. More technical stuff still needs to be done on the full version but it's surprisingly capable once you get the hang of it. No manual, but plenty of help online. Ultimately, does everything I need it to.. Most of the power of the desktop version. Still discovering all of this apps features. I do use Excel on multiple devices (all Android, all Samsung). For a simple quick fix to a spreadsheet, the phone is fine. I have Samasung Galaxy S8. The only reason I say for quick fixes is because of the screen size not necessarily because of the functionality of Excel on the phone. Saving to OneDrive always quick access between devices. Works best for me on my Samsung TabA.. I am well aware of Excel as an excellent software. I have already using in my laptops as ms Office 2013 and MS 365. This version I got for minor usages for the tab. Thank you for allowing me to use this version for minor works. I started using Excel in early nineties while at work. Now I am retired and still love and using my lifetime spreadsheet software Excel.. Upgraded to the newest version because I was getting an error message that my file with the extension of *.xlsx isn't being recognized. I have spoken to someone in customer service and have decided to subscribe. Originally I kept records on a desktop computer using Office 2000 and I was able to use the spreadsheet from Office 2000 and convert it where it's usable in Office 365. There still needs to be some tweaks to make the old file run under the new program.. Works for me. Would be helpful if I could zoom out further as it helps in efficient perusal of large and lengthy data sets. Some other viewing methods too are not accessible in my tablet.", "neg_reviews": "Be warned, the version for android has limited capabilities. If you are an excel user, yu will dislike and despise the version on android. Many of the features and functions do not work, or are unavailable. For example, format paining, spell check, and many of the formula functiobns do not work. Its only good if you need to read a spreadshet from someone else. Don't bother trying to edit on your phone or chromebook. Just wasting time with an inferior version of this business staple.. No matter how many times I open, close, uninstal and reinstall, Excel will not recognize my subscription and allow me to edit my documents as of the last update. Since I have been paying for this app on a monthly subscription basis since February of this year, I would like some answers very expeditiously or a complete refund of all subscription fees. You cannot take someone's money and not deliver what you promise - that's theft. - Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.. My Lord...Microsoft has bowed down to the Gladiator Android, such a shame! If you use this app and have anything of importance in your spreadsheet, be aware the programmers at Microsoft have become extremely lazy. If you happen to mistakenly change a cell, which is easy to do on this miniscule format, your spreadsheet will now be WRONG, Because the lazy programmers at Microsoft have decided it's not important to ask you if you'd like to save your copy? It's just done, right or wrong! Idiots!. Doesn't work right w/ Pixel 3. You can't view any part of the document that you would need to scroll to see so in my case, I can only view the first 4 columns. Also, app does not allow for screen rotation. These two issues make it so the app is completely useless to me. Will delete immediately. Edit: So once again Google comes through for me. After I deleted Excel, I downloaded Google Sheets and it does everything Excel does not.. this app is not free. you have to pay to use it... I already have a Microsoft office account but this app will only take office 365. why cant you buy a program and own it anymore? everyone wants a subscription for their product. I'll go use a free product somewhere else even if it isn't as good.. This app has lots of problem with syncing files to clouds like Dropbox or OneDrive. Even though I'm online, it still says that I'm working offline. It also closes down the file automatically sometimes while I'm going back and forth between apps, but it doesn't know it. So when the file is reopen it still thinks another version is open elsewhere thus it won't save the new changes, and it can't save automatically either. I lost lots of work due to this syncing problem. Very frustrated!!!! :-(. So buggy!! It would be a great app but someone needs to sit down and iron out the bugs. For example if you click on a cell it would bring the keyboard up but not actually let you type so you have to tap on the bar at the top, then you can start typing and after a few characters it will decide it'd prefer to type somewhere else so you just end up with a complete mess.. It used to work great but now it wouldn't open a couple .xlsx files. I downloaded Google Sheets app and it didn't have any problems opening the files. Why does Microsoft have a problem ooening their own files but other companies don't. I would have the same problem on my computer with Microsoft Word files. Open Office didn't have any problem that Microsoft Word had. It's seems strange that the designer's of these file types can't open their own file saved in Microsoft application programs.\ud83d\udc4e. File management no longer works consistently/well. Mine says autosave is on, yet I have lost multiple entries because it did not save to my local drive where the file was opened. Rarely saves by the name with which it was opened. Usual it prompts for file to be saved under another name. When opening file, it doesn't say which is the newest version. Data gets lost. there are the errors that the file cannot be opened but will allow it to be opened from a file manager. Hated it. After renaming a file, you can never open it again. Some important features are also missing. And if you don't open a file for a month, it will automatically get deleted. It's a lot better on computer / laptop. The mobile version is not at all good. Don't download on Mobile otherwise some important work of yours, that you spent days on, might get deleted. Very disappointed with the app and Microsoft.. It worked great, except couldn't unprotect a sheet. And for some reason it kept opening a cached file rather than its updated version. It would know the last modified time but not show its changes, nor edit the updated version. Every other viewing app was accurate. Except this app. Go figure. Forced stop didn't fix anything. Had to reinstall and see what happens, seems OK now but I'm a bit anxious. Edit: NOT ok. Again opens an old version. Usable for me so uninstalling. My biggest problem on my Android phone that really hinders working with this app is that the scroll handle is ridiculously small. It is too small to grab and drag. If you accidentally go to a far away cell, it is impossible to get back to cell A1. That's why I gave the app one star. I would rate it much higher if this was changed. Even in horizontal mode, it isn't working. Also, the Fill Down and Fill Right does not work. There are no fill icons. Just solid rectangles. The MS Help is wrong.. None of the Microsoft Apps will allow you to save files to ANY OTHER location except THEIR cloud solutions or your local device. If you use a network sharing device like many people do today, such as a NAS, this app will NOT work. The app will not allow you to even share a file with another app, if that app connects to a network. That makes this app worthless. The huge benefit of Android being able to share data to other apps is non existant with this app. Huge let down!. Thank you for excel. The previous version has worked well. But since the updates, using excel has created an undesirable experience. The bar graphs are not functioning as before and the entire screen becomes a mess when working out data. \"Be what's next\" is not living up to its full potential. And why is 'notes' now 'comments'?. Configuring office & fetching your files, just this is the message comes when we try to see the account or switch the account. If we open any file will get message as I can't edit it and require to login. Please fix this problem. It's like off-brand Excel. How do you deliberately make something so different than the desktop version. Can't copy and paste, sorting is messed up. Thanks for inspiring me to install the Linux version of LibreOffice. Been using Excel as long as it's been around. This is garbage that I have to pay for. 365 on Chrome. Way past frustrating to use.. Random black and white patchs, like 5.2 cell by 8.3 cell in the spreadsheet. Yeah you read it right, only part of the cell are affected. At times although there is internet, where outlook get new emails and update, spreadsheet just not update. (I did a power automate so excel sheet should be update within a minute after receiving certain emails). There isn't seem to be a way to refresh or see when was last updated. New issues. Some Excel from the same folder open, some don't.. Taking my money and not allowing editing of documents. This app worked great until recently. Now I am unable to edit even though I have a paid office 365 subscription. I keep getting the error \"can't complete task. Sign in with work or school account you use to access office 365\" I'm paying for this monthly and it's not working. Absolutely useless now.. takes forever to open, when It finally opens I can scroll through the document and it erases every part of the document that goes off screen when I try and come back to it. horrible experience when I'm trying to read work documents and I have to keep closing the app and starting over.. Changes to the keyboard has made it impossible to switch from numerical keypad and standard keypad modes as the button that allowed this has been removed. Which means if the column has been set to numerical content you can't put text into it without copying text from another column and pasting it in... even then the formats isn't right and you dant change it... also you can't u lock the page to change the format..e", "pos": "Negative reviews focus on specific issues with the app. Users mention bugs on the Galaxy Z Fold 3, such as difficulty accessing the alpha keyboard when re-editing cells and missing cell edit button.

The first time I played this game I got disappointed because I expected a lot but after several months and decided to give this game a second go, all I can say is WOW! This time, you guys exceeded my expectations and I love it! From the graphics to the gameplay to the character designs all are great! Now this game belongs to one of my favorites. Great Job Devs!

I've been playing this so many times and i got defense Mode!\ud83d\ude06 Because i love this game is the attacks! I learned so many things in. this game is exactly the same one that i play!! And that's it my review \u263a\ufe0f! Bye!. its fun it can be hard and easy at the same time and if i can't get past a level at the story mode i can just play survival to upgrade my character and i like that so throught and all 5 stars <3 i hope this game developer can make much more amazing games in the future.. Amazing fantastic simple yet cool I love the concepts I will like to ask the developers to add more characters and bosses this game is awesome thank you for creating.. Good controlling and fantastic fighting style awesome animation . Too good heroes. You can make it more better if give multiplayer option. And also by making bersker's fighting skills more better.. Pls keep updating. Really fun but soooo broken sometimes. I found an exploit that let's me effectively skip normal levels. Also level 4-3 onward is do-able, but needs balancing. Otherwise its my favourite game right now. Can't wait for multiplayer!. Excellent game for strategy in combat and fun and so good graphics and perfect bosses to fight with. I don't know what else to say cause it's too gooood. And honestly I never even typed down so many words in just one speech but I can minimize it to one word... marvelous. This is a great game with great controls and runs great on my horrible phone. If anyone complains about ads ignore them. All ads can be by passed by setting ur wifi and data off. Overall fun and great!. The graphics is fabulous i loved the game But in starting only four buttons are as i am starting the game by today and i dont know in the future if there are more actions i am very\ud83d\ude04 satisfied .\ud83d\ude09 Satisfied till now . Make more games (in mb please not in money please) And blessed in life. Totally a five star! The graphics are good, the art style is good but the controls for me is very infuriating indeed. Or maybe I just play Apple Knight too long \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Anyway, good game!. I love it so much and I like the City Hunter character the most because it is the only one that is like me and it is so O.P. and it has great combos.Love your game!!!Keep up the good work!\ud83e\udd17. the movement of attack is super good and hope when you go to harder level or in the other mode you can equip 2 or more heroes. This is one of the best game. I love with ever play. Every hero's are best, but City hunter, Lighting Blade, and light bringer; is very very best. Just download it and enjoy; Thanks you very much Gemmob, Adventure \ud83d\ude0e\u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd1f\ud83d\udc4c\u2764\ufe0f.. This game are so cool because it has many level and mode . Then easy to get money. its awesome, but i would like it if all the purchases (with souls) were a little cheaper.. Its a great game. But after I die there is supposed to be a revive option, well the ads after you die don't let you revive. I really like the game, best game I've played in a long time, that's why I don't think this little bug is worth -1 star.. this is a great game! i love the graphics.i like the characters. the only thing is that when I jump on a platform I just go through it just sometimes.even tho this game is great and I'm looking forward to whats in the next update!!! :) :). I love the game it is exciting and I like active fighting so this game is good", "neg_reviews": "boring. PAUSE IS BROKEN SO WHENEVER I PAUSE I CAN'T UNPAUSE SO I HAVE TO CLOSE THE GAME UNTIL YOU FIX IT SUCKS. this is the worst game i ever played i want it to be banned right now. i would rather play those old games than this junk. ithink this game doesnt have love anymore from its creator. this is junk dont play dis when i want to jump on a platform i just go through it. what the... this is history. because its the worst game ever i hate it. but im giving u a chance to improve this game oh and theres bugs and glitches to.. This game is a waste of time. It has potential but as it is, it's laggy and far too many ads. Also, the grinding for money is way too slow. If I could rate it zero stars, I would.. I not saying it bad or anything there a reason why I didnt give it 5 star here are the three problems 1 when you get the lvl where the spider you get kill with the laser and number 2 is when you Upgrade you have to buy with Diamon which makes me mad 3 you have to buy the lighting Dont it have a place already?. Recent update ruined the game - move cooldown ruined the feel of fluid gameplay - the multiple life bars ruined it further - the screen zooming in also sucks. Enhance the game play , im not able to enable the health kit before the I'm not able to complete level 10 . And to upgrade it requires diamond which is not available easily. The laser instantly kills you.. The app keeps crashing and I keep losing my progress. Not to mention that when I finish playing a stage in story mode, it asks me if i want to biy the character i already bought and am pkaying with. If I say no then it closes story mode and I lose my progress. Also I can't turn and hot opponents smoothly. Feels too robotic as you have to stop attacking in one direction and wait for the character to turn and then only you are allowed to hit the enemies on that side.. this giant hit me but it didn't this game doesn't understand me\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21. \ud83d\ude21Fully disapointed i am playing it when it is launched sudden after update i lost my progres and now i need to upgrade lightining blade by gems i want the older veesion back. can't even change the button layout for a platform game like this. no option available at all which makes it harder to play........ and no difficulty level to choose? either you remove yourself or change it otherwise ur just another failure like the rest. Very dissapointed. Three days ago I bought 200 gems by real money. The payment is success but don't receive the additional gems. I had sent email to you since 3 days ago and until now I still haven't received any reply from you. Very bad service. Good bye, I have uninstalled this game \ud83d\udc4c.. Horrible amount of ads! You spend more time in watching video ads instead of playing the game. You pause, you got an ad. You fail, get an ad. In game. Out game. Everywhere ads!. Love the updates you guys are doing a great job, except for the controls they are awkward to manoeuvre with, if I might suggest a configuration menu so that one can set the control button as one is comfortable with.. worst game ever don't waste your time installing this worthless game it itself closes and comes to the homesceen. This says best stickman action but it's not the best stickman action it's worse than any other stickman game. Don't download this game unless u love horrible games.. The best game I have come across in a while. However, because it glitches me out of the game completely, it's frustrating and annoying as you loss valuable progress in the game. Wish the creators did something about it as it would make the game even more popular.. Its bad, i mean, the control is sometimes not working. When i finish my combo, suddenly my attack button won't work at all (automatically the enemy is attacking me) unless i jump or dash, which is led me to die because when i dash i hit the needles or the gear. Also the ads is very annoying. It even popped out when i paused it.. Can you fix the game it keeps kicking me out the game went I click play on it. well that's unfortunate you gonna ruin the game by being greedy, today's update just gonna take this game down, leave the upgrades with only souls this is unfair, prices modifications were okay but put the upgrades back with only souls not gems this is greedy and will only turn this game to p2p game", "pos": "Negative reviews for Overdrive - Ninja Shadow Revenge:\n- Some levels need balancing.\n- Exploits allow skipping normal levels.\n- Revive option after death is hindered by ads.\n- Controls can be infuriating.\n- Some platforms can be glitchy.\n- In-app purchases could be more affordable.\n- Desire for multiplayer option.\n- Fighting skills of certain heroes could be improved.\n- Some users found the game broken at times.\n\n", "neg": "Negative reviews for Overdrive - Ninja Shadow Revenge: \n\n- Pause is broken, forcing players to close the game.\n- Bugs and glitches reported.\n- Game is considered a waste of time due to laggy performance, excessive ads, and slow money grinding.\n- Recent updates have ruined the gameplay experience with move cooldown, multiple life bars, and screen zooming issues.\n- Players frustrated with in-game purchases required for upgrades.\n- Controls are awkward and not responsive, leading to frustration during gameplay.\n- Excessive amount of ads interrupting the gaming experience.\n- Players experiencing crashes and losing progress.\n- Payment for in-game purchases successful but not receiving the additional items.\n- Lack of customization options for controls and difficulty levels.\n\n", "summary": "Overdrive - Ninja Shadow Revenge is an action platformer set in a futuristic world where players control a cyborg ninja seeking revenge against a Dark Clan that has taken over the government.
